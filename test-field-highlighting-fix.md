# Field Highlighting Fix - Test Summary

## Problem
In the project timecard approval tab's rejection mode, when a user:
1. Selects a field and modifies its time value
2. Changes it back to its original value
The field would remain highlighted red, even though the value matched the original.

## Root Cause
The `isEdited` logic in `SimpleEditableField` only checked if a field existed in the `fieldEdits` object, without comparing the actual values:

```typescript
// OLD (incorrect) logic
const isEdited = fieldEdits[fieldId] !== undefined
```

## Solution
Updated the logic to compare normalized values and only consider a field "edited" if:
1. It exists in `fieldEdits` AND
2. The current value differs from the original value

```typescript
// NEW (correct) logic
const hasFieldEdit = fieldEdits[fieldId] !== undefined
const normalizeTimeValue = (timeValue: string | null | undefined): string | null => {
  if (!timeValue) return null
  try {
    return new Date(timeValue).toISOString()
  } catch {
    return null
  }
}

const isEdited = hasFieldEdit && 
  normalizeTimeValue(currentValue) !== normalizeTimeValue(originalValue)
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. SimpleEditableField Component (`components/timecards/simple-editable-field.tsx`)
- Added `normalizeTimeValue` helper function for consistent time comparison
- Updated `isEdited` logic to compare actual values, not just existence in fieldEdits
- Modified `handleInputChange` to remove field from fieldEdits when value matches original

### 2. Parent Component (`components/timecards/project-timecard-approval.tsx`)
- Updated `handleFieldEdit` to handle `undefined` values by removing fields from fieldEdits
- This ensures fields that match original values are completely removed from the edits object

### 3. Test Coverage (`components/timecards/__tests__/field-highlighting-fix.test.tsx`)
- Added comprehensive tests to verify the highlighting logic works correctly
- Tests cover: matching original values, different values, null handling, and field removal

## Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix:
- Field gets added to `fieldEdits` when modified
- Field stays in `fieldEdits` even when changed back to original
- Field remains highlighted red indefinitely

### After Fix:
- Field gets added to `fieldEdits` when modified to different value
- Field gets removed from `fieldEdits` when changed back to original
- Field highlighting correctly reflects actual differences from original

## Test Results
✅ All new field highlighting tests pass
✅ Core functionality preserved
✅ No breaking changes to existing API

The fix ensures that field highlighting accurately reflects whether a field's current value differs from its original value, providing better user feedback during the timecard rejection process.
