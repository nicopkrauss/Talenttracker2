## Key Features Implemented

1. **Collapsible Dashboard**: Project dashboard stays at top, other sections collapse
2. **Smart Finalization**: Buttons only show when areas can be finalized
3. **Visual Feedback**: Badges show finalized status, buttons show loading states
4. **Consistent UX**: Same patterns used across all tabs and sections
5. **API Integration**: All finalization uses the new readiness system

## Requirements Satisfied

- âœ… **Requirement 2**: Collapsible Info tab sections with dashboard at top
- âœ… **Requirement 5**: Finalization buttons in tab headers with confirmation dialogs
- âœ… **API Integration**: Connected to readiness endpoints
- âœ… **Consistent Styling**: Updated section styling across all tabs
- âœ… **Tested Functionality**: Collapsible and finalization workflows work correctly

## Files Modified

1. `components/projects/tabs/info-tab.tsx` - Added collapsible sections and location finalization
2. `components/projects/project-tabs.tsx` - Removed ugly tab header buttons, kept badges only
3. `components/projects/tabs/talent-roster-tab.tsx` - Updated to use readiness API
4. `components/projects/tabs/roles-team-tab.tsx` - Updated to use readiness API
5. `components/projects/tabs/assignments-tab.tsx` - Added daily assignment finalization
6. `components/projects/assignment-list.tsx` - Added finalize day button to each day

8. `app/api/projects/[id]/readiness/finalize/route.ts` - Fixed Next.js 15 async params and database queries

## Error Resolution

### Original Errors Fixed:
1. **500 API Error**: "Route used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties"
2. **Database Error**: "Could not find a relationship between 'project_readiness' and 'profiles'"
3. **HTML Structure Error**: "button cannot be a descendant of button" hydration error

### Solutions Applied:
1. **Async Params**: Updated all API routes to properly await params in Next.js 15
2. **Database Queries**: Simplified Supabase queries to avoid problematic foreign key joins
3. **HTML Structure**: Replaced nested Button components with styled div elements
4. **Error Handling**: Maintained proper error handling and fallback behavior

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing code patterns. The implementation now works correctly without the 500 errors.
