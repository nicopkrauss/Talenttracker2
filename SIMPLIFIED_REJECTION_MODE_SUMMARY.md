# Simplified Enhanced Rejection Mode - Implementation Summary

## What I've Done

### 1. Simplified State Management
**Before**: Complex multi-layer state
- `isRejectionMode` + `selectedFields` + `isEditMode` + `fieldEdits`
- Complex button logic with multiple modes

**After**: Simple single-layer state
- `isRejectionMode` + `fieldEdits` only
- Fields become immediately editable when clicked

### 2. Created SimpleEditableField Component
**File**: `components/timecards/simple-editable-field.tsx`

**Key Features**:
- Local `isEditing` state per field
- Click field → immediately editable (no selection step)
- Auto-blur to exit edit mode
- Clear visual feedback for edited vs original values
- No complex prop drilling

### 3. Updated Approval Component
**Removed**:
- `selectedFields` state
- `isEditMode` state  
- Complex button logic (`canEdit`, edit/done buttons)
- Multi-step selection → edit workflow

**Simplified**:
- Single "Reject" button that enables rejection mode
- Fields become immediately editable when clicked
- Single "Apply Changes & Return" or "Reject Without Changes" button

### 4. Updated MultiDayTimecardDisplay
**Changed**:
- Removed complex EditableTimeField component
- Uses new SimpleEditableField component
- Simplified props (no selectedFields, isEditMode)
- Cleaner component structure

## How It Works Now

### User Flow
1. **Click "Reject"** → Enters rejection mode
2. **Click any field** → Field becomes immediately editable with time input
3. **Edit time** → Change is saved to fieldEdits
4. **Click outside field** → Exits edit mode for that field
5. **Click "Apply Changes"** → Submits with edits or rejects without changes

### Technical Flow
1. `isRejectionMode = true` enables editing on all fields
2. Each field has local `isEditing` state
3. `fieldEdits` tracks which fields have been modified
4. Modified fields are automatically flagged for rejection
5. Single submission handles both edit-and-return or reject-only

## Benefits
- **Much simpler**: No multi-step selection process
- **Intuitive UX**: Click field → edit immediately  
- **No conflicts**: Each field manages its own edit state
- **Easier to debug**: Fewer moving parts
- **Clear feedback**: Obvious visual distinction between original and edited values

## Testing
Try this sequence:
1. Go to Approval tab
2. Click "Reject" 
3. Click any time field → should immediately show time input
4. Change the time → should show "Modified" indicator
5. Click "Apply Changes & Return" → should submit successfully

This approach eliminates the complexity that was causing the click handler conflicts.
