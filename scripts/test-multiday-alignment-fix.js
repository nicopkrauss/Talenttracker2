console.log('üß™ Testing Multi-Day Timecard Alignment Fix')
console.log('==========================================')

console.log('\nüéØ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:')
console.log('In multi-day timecards, day headers had inconsistent alignment:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Day 1: Left-aligned (using flex items-center justify-between)')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Day 2+: Center-aligned (using text-center class)')
console.log('‚Ä¢ This created visual inconsistency in the breakdown section')

console.log('\n‚úÖ FIX APPLIED:')
console.log('1. REMOVED: text-center class from additional day headers')
console.log('2. CHANGED: <div className="text-center pb-2"> to <div className="pb-2">')
console.log('3. RESULT: All day headers now consistently left-aligned')

console.log('\nüìã Expected Results:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Day 1 header: Left-aligned (unchanged - this was correct)')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Day 2+ headers: Now left-aligned (changed from center-aligned)')
console.log('‚Ä¢ All day headers have consistent alignment throughout the timecard')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Visual hierarchy is now uniform across all days')

console.log('\nüîç To verify the fix:')
console.log('1. Navigate to /timecards page')
console.log('2. Look at the breakdown tab')
console.log('3. Find a multi-day timecard and expand it')
console.log('4. Check that all day headers (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, etc.) are left-aligned')
console.log('5. Verify the alignment is consistent across all days')

console.log('\n‚ú® MULTI-DAY ALIGNMENT FIX COMPLETE!')
console.log('All day headers in multi-day timecards now have consistent left alignment.')
