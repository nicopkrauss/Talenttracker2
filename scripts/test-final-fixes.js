âœ… Final Fixes Applied:

1. **NextJS 15 Params Fix**
   - Fixed phase history route to properly await params
   - Eliminated "Route used params.id" errors
   - File: app/api/projects/[id]/phase/history/route.ts

2. **Removed Lazy Loading from Tabs**
   - Tabs now load immediately instead of showing loading states
   - Better UX - no more waiting for tabs to load
   - File: components/projects/mode-specific-components.tsx

3. **Fixed Type Export Warnings**
   - Removed problematic re-exports from phase-engine.ts
   - Types are properly exported from lib/types/project-phase.ts
   - Should eliminate build warnings

4. **Auto-refresh Back to 30s** (as requested)
   - Operations dashboard refreshes every 30 seconds
   - File: components/projects/operations-dashboard.tsx

5. **Shared Phase Context** (performance improvement kept)
   - Still prevents duplicate /phase API calls
   - Only 1 API call per page instead of multiple

ðŸ“Š Expected Results:
- âœ… No more NextJS 15 params errors
- âœ… Tabs load immediately (no loading states)
- âœ… Reduced type export warnings
- âœ… Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- âœ… Still only 1 /phase call per page load
- âœ… project_attachments gracefully handled

ðŸ§ª To Test:
1. Navigate to project pages
2. Switch between Configuration/Operations modes
3. Check that tabs load immediately
4. Verify no console errors
5. Monitor Network tab for reduced API calls

The app should now have the best of both worlds:
- Immediate tab loading (better UX)
- Reduced API calls (better performance)
- Clean console (no errors)
