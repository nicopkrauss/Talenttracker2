console.log('===================================')

console.log('\nüéØ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:')
console.log('Inconsistent spacing between Time Summary and Timecard cards:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Time Summary card: Uses standard Card with gap-6 and proper CardHeader')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Timecard card: Had gap-0 and no proper CardHeader structure')
console.log('‚Ä¢ This created visual inconsistency in the approve tab layout')

console.log('\n‚úÖ FIX APPLIED:')
console.log('1. REMOVED: gap-0 from Timecard Card className')
console.log('2. ADDED: Proper CardHeader structure for timecard header')
console.log('3. UPDATED: Uses CardTitle component like Time Summary')
console.log('4. MATCHED: Structure now consistent with Time Summary card')

console.log('\nüîß Technical Changes:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Card className: Removed gap-0, now uses default gap-6')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Header structure: Now uses CardHeader + CardTitle')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Icon + title: Calendar icon with "Timecard" title')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Consistent with: Time Summary card structure')

console.log('\nüìã Expected Results:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Time Summary card: Standard spacing with CardHeader')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Timecard card: Matching spacing with proper CardHeader')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Visual consistency: Both cards have same top spacing')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Professional layout: Uniform card structure throughout')

console.log('\nüîç To verify the fix:')
console.log('1. Navigate to /timecards page')
console.log('2. Switch to approve tab')
console.log('3. Compare spacing between Time Summary and Timecard cards')
console.log('4. Verify both cards have consistent top spacing')
console.log('5. Check that headers are properly aligned')

console.log('\n‚ú® CARD SPACING CONSISTENCY FIX COMPLETE!')
console.log('Time Summary and Timecard cards now have matching, professional spacing.')
