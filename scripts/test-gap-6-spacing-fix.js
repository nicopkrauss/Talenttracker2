console.log('üß™ Testing Gap-6 Spacing Fix')
console.log('============================')

console.log('\nüéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:')
console.log('The issue was the gap-6 class in the Card component:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Card component has: "flex flex-col gap-6" in its default classes')
console.log('‚Ä¢ gap-6 = 1.5rem gap between all flex children (CardHeader and CardContent)')
console.log('‚Ä¢ This created excessive spacing between header and content sections')

console.log('\n‚úÖ FIX APPLIED:')
console.log('1. ADDED: gap-2 class to Card component in MultiDayTimecardDisplay')
console.log('2. OVERRIDES: The default gap-6 with gap-2 (0.5rem instead of 1.5rem)')
console.log('3. RESULT: Much tighter spacing between header and content sections')

console.log('\nüìä Spacing Comparison:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ BEFORE: gap-6 = 1.5rem (24px) - excessive spacing')
console.log('‚Ä¢ AFTER:  gap-2 = 0.5rem (8px) - normal, tight spacing')
console.log('‚Ä¢ REDUCTION: 75% less spacing between sections')

console.log('\nüìã Expected Results:')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Cards with user names should have much tighter spacing below the name')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Admin notes should appear much closer to the header section')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Cards without user names should also have reduced spacing')
console.log('‚Ä¢ Overall card layout should look more compact and professional')
console.log('‚Ä¢ No more unusual large gaps between header and content')

console.log('\nüîç To verify the fix:')
console.log('1. Navigate to /timecards page')
console.log('2. Look at the breakdown tab')
console.log('3. Compare cards with and without admin notes')
console.log('4. Check that the gap between header and content is now much smaller')
console.log('5. Verify the spacing looks natural and professional')

console.log('\n‚ú® GAP-6 SPACING FIX COMPLETE!')
console.log('The excessive 1.5rem gap has been reduced to 0.5rem for much better spacing.')
console.log('This should eliminate both spacing issues you identified.')
