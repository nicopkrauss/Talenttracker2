âœ… Performance Improvements Applied:

1. **Shared Phase Context**
   - Created ProjectPhaseProvider to share phase data across components
   - Eliminates duplicate /phase API calls from multiple guards
   - Single API call per project instead of multiple

2. **Reduced Auto-Refresh Frequency**
   - Changed from 30 seconds to 2 minutes (120 seconds)
   - Reduces server load by 75%

3. **Debounced Real-time Updates**
   - Added 1-second debounce to real-time subscriptions
   - Prevents rapid-fire API calls from database changes
   - Batches multiple changes into single update

4. **Optimized Hook Usage**
   - Updated useSpecificPhaseFeatureAvailability to use shared context
   - Removed individual fetch calls from each guard component

ðŸ“Š Expected Results:
- Reduced /phase API calls from ~4 per page load to 1
- Reduced /live-status calls from every 30s to every 2 minutes
- Smoother UI with debounced updates
- Better server performance and reduced database load

ðŸ§ª To Test:
1. Navigate to a project's Operations tab
2. Monitor Network tab in DevTools
3. Verify only 1 /phase call on page load
4. Verify /live-status calls every 2 minutes instead of 30 seconds
5. Check console for reduced error messages
