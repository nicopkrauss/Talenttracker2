âœ… Project Phase Section Removal Applied:

**What was removed**:
- PhaseManagementWidget from project overview card
- Import statement for phase-management-dashboard
- The entire "Phase Management" section at bottom of overview

**Files Changed**:
- components/projects/project-overview-card.tsx

**Changes Made**:
1. Removed PhaseManagementWidget component from overview
2. Removed unused import
3. Cleaned up the border-t div wrapper

ðŸ“Š Expected Results:
- âœ… Project overview card no longer shows phase management section
- âœ… Cleaner, simpler project overview
- âœ… No more phase-related API calls from overview card
- âœ… Reduced visual clutter

ðŸ§ª To Test:
1. Navigate to any project page
2. Look at the project overview card (top section)
3. Verify no phase management widget is shown
4. Overview should be cleaner and simpler

The project overview now focuses on core project information:
- Project dates and location
- Production company and contact
- Escort assignment tracking
- Setup progress checklist
- Basic statistics

Phase management can still be accessed through other parts of the app if needed.
