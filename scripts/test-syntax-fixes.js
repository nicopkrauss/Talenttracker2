✅ Fixes Applied:

1. **Auto-refresh Frequency**
   - Reverted back to 30 seconds as requested
   - Operations dashboard will refresh every 30s

2. **Syntax Error Fix**
   - Fixed uncommented code in phase-action-items-service.ts
   - Properly commented out TODO section

3. **Type Export Issues**
   - Types are properly exported in lib/types/project-phase.ts
   - May need Next.js cache clear to resolve build warnings

🧪 To Test:
1. Restart the development server to clear build cache
2. Navigate to project Operations tab
3. Verify auto-refresh works every 30 seconds
4. Check that syntax errors are resolved

📝 Commands to run:
- Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C)
- Run: npm run dev
- Check for reduced console errors
