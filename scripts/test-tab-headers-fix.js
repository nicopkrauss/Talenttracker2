âœ… Tab Headers Loading Fix Applied:

**Problem**: Tab headers were not appearing immediately on page load
- Entire ProjectTabs component was wrapped in PhaseFeatureAvailabilityGuard
- Guard was making API calls to check phase availability before showing tabs
- This caused tab headers to show loading skeleton instead of appearing immediately

**Root Cause**: 
- PhaseFeatureAvailabilityGuard in project-detail-layout.tsx was wrapping the entire tabs component
- Guard shows loading skeleton while featureCheck.loading is true
- Tab headers don't need phase checking - they should always be visible

**Solution**: Removed phase guards from layout level
- Tab headers now appear immediately on page load
- Individual tab content still has appropriate phase guards where needed
- Better separation of concerns: headers vs content

**Files Changed**:
- components/projects/project-detail-layout.tsx

**Changes Made**:
1. Removed PhaseFeatureAvailabilityGuard wrapper from ConfigurationModeComponents.Tabs
2. Removed PhaseFeatureAvailabilityGuard wrapper from OperationsModeComponents.Dashboard
3. Tab headers now render immediately without waiting for phase API calls
4. Individual tab components still have their own guards (e.g., AssignmentGuard)

ðŸ“Š Expected Results:
- âœ… Tab headers (Info, Roles & Team, Talent Roster, Assignments, Settings) appear immediately
- âœ… No loading skeleton where tab headers should be
- âœ… Tab content still respects phase availability when appropriate
- âœ… Much better perceived performance and UX

ðŸ§ª To Test:
1. Navigate to any project page
2. Tab headers should appear immediately (no loading delay)
3. Click on tabs - content may still load based on individual tab logic
4. No more loading skeleton where tab headers should be

The fix separates tab navigation (always available) from tab content (phase-dependent).
