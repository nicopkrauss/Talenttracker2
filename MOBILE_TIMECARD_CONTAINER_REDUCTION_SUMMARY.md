# Mobile Timecard Container Reduction Summary

## Problem
The mobile approve tab had too many nested containers, with the mobile timecard grid wrapped in its own `Card` component while being used inside the `MultiDayTimecardDisplay` component that already had a `Card` wrapper. This created unnecessary nesting and visual separation between the person's name and the timecard grid.

## Solution
Removed the nested `Card` wrapper from the `MobileTimecardGrid` component so that the grid content appears directly within the same container as the person's name in the parent `MultiDayTimecardDisplay` component.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Simplified MobileTimecardGrid Structure**
**File**: `components/timecards/mobile-timecard-grid.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
return (
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>...</CardTitle>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      {/* Grid content */}
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
)
```

**After**:
```typescript
return (
  <div>
    {/* Grid content directly */}
  </div>
)
```

### 2. **Removed Unused Imports and Props**
- Removed `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle` imports
- Removed unused props:
  - `actionButtons`
  - `showHeader`
  - `showSummaryInHeader`
  - `personName`
  - `personRole`
  - `personRoleBadge`
  - `timecardCount`

### 3. **Updated Tests**
**File**: `components/timecards/__tests__/mobile-timecard-grid.test.tsx`
- Updated test expectations to match the simplified component structure
- Fixed day name assertion to expect uppercase format (`MON` instead of `Mon`)
- Simplified rejection mode test since header text was removed

## Result

### ✅ **Reduced Container Nesting**
- **Before**: `Card` → `CardContent` → `Card` → `CardContent` → Grid
- **After**: `Card` → `CardContent` → Grid

### ✅ **Improved Layout Integration**
- The mobile timecard grid now appears in the same visual container as the person's name
- No unnecessary visual separation between user info and timecard data
- Cleaner, more cohesive mobile layout

### ✅ **Maintained Functionality**
- All timecard grid functionality preserved
- Swapped axes layout still works (times horizontal, dates vertical)
- Rejection mode, field editing, and validation all intact
- Week navigation for multi-week timecards still functional

### ✅ **Build Status**
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Tests updated and passing
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Details

The mobile grid now renders as a simple `div` containing:
1. **Week navigation** (for multi-week timecards)
2. **Time column headers** (Check In, Break Start, Break End, Check Out)
3. **Date rows** with time values in a CSS Grid layout

The parent `MultiDayTimecardDisplay` component handles:
- User name and role badges
- Status badges and statistics
- Admin notes
- Card wrapper and styling
- Mobile/desktop responsive switching

## Impact
This change creates a much cleaner mobile approve tab experience where the timecard grid feels integrated with the user information rather than being a separate nested component. The visual hierarchy is now more logical and the interface feels less cluttered on mobile devices.
