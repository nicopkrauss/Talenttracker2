# Registration UI Changes - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Changes Implemented

The registration form has been updated with the requested UI improvements for better user experience and clearer role selection.

## ðŸ”§ Specific Changes Made

### 1. Role Selection Method
**Before:** Dropdown select menu
**After:** Full-width button grid

- **Implementation:** Replaced `<Select>` component with individual `<Button>` components
- **Styling:** Each button spans full width of container with consistent height (h-12)
- **Interaction:** Buttons show selected state with primary variant and ring styling
- **Accessibility:** Proper focus states and keyboard navigation maintained

### 2. Role Button Order
The buttons now appear in the specified order:
1. **Talent Escort** (top position)
2. **Talent Logistics Coordinator** 
3. **Supervisor**
4. **In-House Staff** (bottom position)

### 3. Terms and Conditions Placement
**Before:** Terms checkbox appeared immediately after role selection
**After:** Terms checkbox moved to main form section

- **Logic:** Terms checkbox now only appears after a role is selected
- **Placement:** Positioned after all other form fields but before submit button
- **Conditional Display:** Part of the conditional form fields that show after role selection

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements

### Button Styling
- **Width:** 100% container width as requested
- **Height:** Consistent 48px (h-12) for good touch targets
- **States:** 
  - Unselected: Outline variant with subtle border
  - Selected: Primary variant with ring accent
  - Disabled: Reduced opacity during loading
- **Typography:** Left-aligned text with medium font weight
- **Transitions:** Smooth 200ms transitions for all state changes

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Role Selection:** Prominent button grid draws attention
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Form fields appear only after role selection
- **Terms Placement:** Logical flow with terms appearing before final submission

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile:** Full-width buttons work well on small screens
- **Desktop:** Buttons maintain consistent appearance across screen sizes
- **Touch Targets:** 48px height meets accessibility guidelines

## ðŸ”„ User Flow Changes

### New Registration Flow
1. **Step 1:** User sees role selection buttons immediately
2. **Step 2:** User clicks desired role button (visual feedback provided)
3. **Step 3:** Form fields appear with smooth animation
4. **Step 4:** User fills out personal information
5. **Step 5:** User checks terms agreement (now part of main form)
6. **Step 6:** User submits registration

### Benefits
- **Clearer Intent:** Button layout makes role selection more obvious
- **Better Mobile UX:** Large touch targets easier to tap on mobile devices
- **Logical Flow:** Terms agreement appears with other form commitments
- **Visual Feedback:** Selected role clearly highlighted throughout form completion

## ðŸ§ª Technical Implementation

          className="w-full h-12 justify-start text-left">
    {roleLabel}
  </Button>
  // ... repeated for each role
</div>
```
