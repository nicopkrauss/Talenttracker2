# Dev Mode Role Switcher Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a development mode feature that allows Nico Krauss (nicopkrauss@gmail.com) to switch between different user roles for testing purposes.

## Files Created

### 1. `components/dev-mode/dev-role-switcher.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Original floating UI component for role switching (kept for reference)
- **Status**: Not currently used in favor of top navigation integration

### 2. `components/dev-mode/dev-mode-button.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Compact dev mode button for top navigation bar
- **Features**:
  - Only visible for dev email (`nicopkrauss@gmail.com`)
  - Switch between system roles: admin, in_house, supervisor, coordinator, talent_escort, or none
  - Dropdown interface that fits in navigation bar
  - Real-time role updates with visual feedback
  - Shows current effective role
  - Compact design suitable for top navigation

### 3. `app/api/dev/update-role/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: API endpoint for updating user roles
- **Security**: 
  - Restricted to dev email only
  - Validates user authentication
  - Validates role values
- **Functionality**:
  - Updates system role in database
  - Returns success/error status
  - Logs changes for audit trail

### 4. `components/dev-mode/index.ts`
- **Purpose**: Export file for dev mode components

### 5. `components/dev-mode/README.md`
- **Purpose**: Documentation for dev mode features

## Integration Points

### Modified Files
- **`components/navigation/desktop-navigation.tsx`**: Added DevModeButton to top navigation bar next to user menu
- **`components/dev-mode/index.ts`**: Updated to export both components

## How It Works

1. **Visibility**: Component only renders when logged in as `nicopkrauss@gmail.com`
2. **UI**: Appears as a "Dev" button in the top navigation bar next to the profile menu
3. **Role Switching**: 
   - Click "Dev" button to open dropdown
   - Select new system role from dropdown
   - API call updates database
   - Page refreshes to apply changes throughout app
4. **Persistence**: Role changes persist until manually changed again

## Usage Instructions

1. Log in as `nicopkrauss@gmail.com`
2. Look for "Dev" button in the top navigation bar (next to your profile)
3. Click to open the role switcher dropdown
4. Select desired system role from dropdown
5. Changes apply immediately and page refreshes
6. Navigate around app to test different role permissions

## Security Features

- **Email Restriction**: Hard-coded to only work for dev email
- **Authentication Required**: Must be logged in to access
- **API Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **Audit Trail**: All role changes are logged in database

## Future Enhancements

- Project role switching (requires team assignment implementation)
- Role history/logging UI
- Quick role presets for common testing scenarios
- Integration with project context switching
- Temporary role switching (revert after session)

## Testing Scenarios

With this tool, you can now easily test:
- Admin features (project management, user approval, etc.)
- In-house manager capabilities
- Supervisor permissions and views
- Coordinator access levels
- Talent escort restricted views
- No system role (project-only access)

The role switcher makes it easy to verify that role-based access control is working correctly throughout the application without needing multiple test accounts.
