# Debug Steps for Enhanced Rejection Mode Edit Functionality

## Current Issue
The edit mode within rejection mode is not working - users can select fields but when they click "Edit Selected", the input fields don't become editable.

## Debug Steps Added

### 1. Console Logging
Added console.log statements to track:
- Field selection/deselection in `toggleFieldSelection`
- Edit mode entry/exit in `enterEditMode`/`exitEditMode`
- Field edit handling in `handleFieldEdit`
- Field ID generation in `getFieldId`
- Field state in `EditableTimeField` component

### 2. Debug Information Display
Added debug info display in `EditableTimeField` showing:
- Current mode (REJECT/NORMAL)
- Edit mode status (YES/NO)
- Field selection status (YES/NO)
- Field ID

### 3. TypeScript Fixes
Fixed TypeScript issues with `originalValue` type mismatches by ensuring all values are properly typed as `string | null`.

## Testing Steps

1. **Enter Rejection Mode**: Click "Reject" button
2. **Select Fields**: Click on time fields to select them (should see red highlighting)
3. **Check Console**: Verify field selection is being logged correctly
4. **Enter Edit Mode**: Click "Edit Selected" button
5. **Check Console**: Verify edit mode entry is being logged
6. **Check Field State**: Look at debug info under each field to verify:
   - Mode: REJECT
   - Edit: YES
   - Selected: YES
7. **Try Editing**: Click on selected fields to see if input appears

## Expected Behavior

When a field is:
- In rejection mode (`isRejectionMode = true`)
- Selected (`isSelected = true`) 
- In edit mode (`isEditMode = true`)

Then `isEditable` should be `true` and the field should show a time input instead of the display text.

## Potential Issues to Check

1. **Field ID Mismatch**: The field IDs used for selection might not match the field IDs used for editing
2. **State Timing**: The state updates might not be synchronous
3. **Event Handling**: The click handlers might be interfering with each other
4. **Component Re-rendering**: The component might not be re-rendering when state changes

## Next Steps

Run the application and follow the testing steps above, then check the console logs to identify where the issue is occurring.
