   ```sql
   -- Apply existing timecard migration
   migrations/005_add_missing_timecard_columns.sql
   
   -- Create new tables
   CREATE TABLE shifts (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
     project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
     date DATE NOT NULL,
     check_in_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     check_out_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'checked_out',
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE breaks (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     shift_id UUID REFERENCES shifts(id),
     start_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     end_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     duration_minutes INTEGER,

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Build on Existing Foundation
- **Leverage Current Architecture**: Use existing Supabase setup, component patterns, and database structure
- **Extend Rather Than Replace**: Build on the excellent project management foundation
- **Maintain Consistency**: Follow established patterns for theming, navigation, and data flow

### Mobile-First Approach
- **Touch-Friendly Design**: All new components must work perfectly on mobile devices
- **Offline Capability**: Time tracking should work with poor network conditions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core functionality, add polish incrementally

### Real-Time by Default
- **Supabase Realtime**: Use existing WebSocket infrastructure for all operational features
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with server reconciliation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent modifications gracefully

### Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for each component before implementation
- **User Testing**: Validate with actual users after each phase
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure mobile performance remains optimal

- **Scope Expansion**: Stick to defined phases and resist feature creep
- **Timeline Pressure**: Allow buffer time for testing and refinement
- **Integration Challenges**: Plan for complexity when connecting new systems

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Begin Phase 1 with database schema completion
2. **Resource Planning**: Ensure development resources are allocated for 10-week timeline
3. **User Coordination**: Identify test users for each phase validation
4. **Environment Setup**: Prepare staging environment for safe testing
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement performance and error monitoring

This roadmap transforms your excellent project management foundation into a complete operational management platform, prioritizing the core time tracking functionality that makes the system valuable for live production use.
