- **Changes**: 
  - Replaced old `ModeToggle` with `PhaseModeToggleMinimal`
  - Replaced status badge with `PhaseIndicatorCompact`
  - Added phase fetching logic with fallback mapping
  - Integrated with phase system API

### 2. Created Phase-Aware Mode Hook
- **File**: `hooks/use-project-phase-mode.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Fetches current project phase from API
  - Provides intelligent mode recommendations based on phase
  - Maintains URL and localStorage persistence
  - Includes keyboard shortcuts (Alt+C, Alt+O)
  - Returns phase state information for components

### 3. Updated Project Detail Layout
- **File**: `components/projects/project-detail-layout.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced `useProjectMode` with `useProjectPhaseMode`
  - Updated to use phase-aware components
  - Maintained backward compatibility with ReadinessProvider
  - Removed old activate/archive handlers

### 4. Enhanced Project Overview Card
- **File**: `components/projects/project-overview-card.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed old activate/archive buttons
  - Added `PhaseManagementWidget` for phase transitions
  - Updated setup progress display to be phase-agnostic
  - Simplified interface by removing activation handlers

### 5. Created Phase Feature Availability System
- **File**: `hooks/use-phase-feature-availability.ts`
- **File**: `components/projects/phase-feature-availability-guard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Phase-based feature availability checking
  - Replaces old readiness-based system
  - Provides phase-appropriate guidance
  - Includes specific guards for common features

### 6. Updated Type System
- **File**: `lib/types.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Extended `ProjectStatus` type to include all phase values
  - Added support for: `'staffing' | 'pre_show' | 'post_show' | 'complete'`
  - Maintained backward compatibility

## Requirements Compliance

### ✅ Requirement 2.1: Display Current Phase Prominently
- Phase indicator shown in project header
- Uses `PhaseIndicatorCompact` component
- Clear visual styling with phase-appropriate colors

### ✅ Requirement 2.2: Show Phase-Appropriate Action Items  
- `PhaseManagementWidget` displays in project overview
- Action items filtered by current phase
- Integration with phase action items system

### ✅ Requirement 2.3: Phase-Specific Functionality
- Mode recommendations based on current phase
- Feature availability guards use phase logic
- Phase-appropriate guidance messages

### ✅ Requirement 2.4: Configuration Mode Features
- Always available but shows phase-appropriate content
- Recommended for prep and staffing phases
- Integrated with existing configuration tabs

### ✅ Requirement 2.5: Operations Mode Features  
- Always available with phase-aware functionality
- Recommended for active and pre-show phases
- Limited functionality shown for setup phases

### ✅ Requirement 2.6: Phase Transition Integration
- `PhaseManagementWidget` handles transitions
- Replaces old activate button functionality
- Shows transition readiness and blockers

### ✅ Requirement 2.7: Navigation Phase Awareness
- Mode toggle shows phase-based recommendations
- URL and localStorage persistence maintained
- Keyboard shortcuts preserved

### ✅ Requirement 2.8: Replace Activation System
- Removed old activate/archive buttons
- Replaced with phase transition system
- Maintained all functionality through phase management

## Technical Implementation Details

### Phase-Aware Mode Logic
```typescript
const getIntelligentDefaultMode = (phase: ProjectPhase | null): 'configuration' | 'operations' => {
  if (!phase) return defaultMode
  
  // Recommend configuration mode for setup phases
  if (phase === ProjectPhase.PREP || phase === ProjectPhase.STAFFING) {
    return 'configuration'
  }
  // Recommend operations mode for active phases
  if (phase === ProjectPhase.ACTIVE || phase === ProjectPhase.PRE_SHOW || phase === ProjectPhase.POST_SHOW) {
    return 'operations'
  }
  // Default to configuration for other phases
  return defaultMode
}
```

### Feature Availability by Phase
- **Time Tracking**: Available during ACTIVE and POST_SHOW phases
- **Assignments**: Available during STAFFING, PRE_SHOW, and ACTIVE phases  
- **Location Tracking**: Available during PRE_SHOW and ACTIVE phases
- **Team Management**: Available during PREP, STAFFING, and PRE_SHOW phases
- **Timecards**: Available during POST_SHOW and COMPLETE phases

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintains existing ReadinessProvider for gradual migration
- Preserves URL parameters and localStorage behavior
- Fallback mapping from old status to phase system
- Existing components continue to work during transition

## Files Created
1. `hooks/use-project-phase-mode.ts` - Phase-aware mode management
2. `hooks/use-phase-feature-availability.ts` - Phase-based feature availability
3. `components/projects/phase-feature-availability-guard.tsx` - Phase-aware feature guards
4. `components/projects/__tests__/phase-mode-toggle-integration.test.tsx` - Integration tests

## Files Modified
1. `components/projects/project-header.tsx` - Phase integration
2. `components/projects/project-detail-layout.tsx` - Phase-aware layout
3. `components/projects/project-overview-card.tsx` - Phase management widget
4. `lib/types.ts` - Extended project status types

## Migration Path
The implementation provides a smooth migration path:
1. **Phase 1**: New components work alongside existing system
2. **Phase 2**: Gradual replacement of readiness-based logic
3. **Phase 3**: Full phase system adoption
4. **Phase 4**: Removal of deprecated activation code

## Testing Status
- Integration test framework created
- Component compilation verified
- API integration points identified
- Manual testing required for full verification

## Next Steps
1. Manual testing of phase transitions
2. Verification of mode recommendations
3. Testing of feature availability guards
4. Performance optimization if needed
5. Documentation updates for users

## Impact Assessment
- **User Experience**: Improved with phase-appropriate guidance
- **Developer Experience**: Cleaner API with phase-based logic
- **Performance**: Minimal impact, lazy loading preserved
- **Maintainability**: Better separation of concerns
- **Scalability**: Extensible phase system for future needs

This implementation successfully replaces the old mode toggle system with a comprehensive phase-aware solution that provides better user guidance, cleaner code architecture, and seamless integration with the project lifecycle management system.
