# Login Page JWT Error Fix

## Problem
After clearing the database, users were seeing JWT errors on the login page:
- "User from sub claim in JWT does not exist"
- "Failed to fetch user profile" errors
- Auth context trying to fetch profiles even when no user is logged in

## Root Cause
1. **Stale JWT Tokens**: Browser had JWT tokens from before the database was cleared
2. **No RLS Policies**: Database queries were failing without proper authentication
3. **Auth Context Overfetching**: Auth context was trying to fetch user profiles even on public pages
4. **Middleware Overfetching**: Middleware was trying to get user profiles for invalid sessions

## Solution

### 1. Updated Auth Context (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)
- Added session validation before attempting to fetch user profiles
- Added specific handling for "user_not_found" JWT errors
- Automatically clear invalid sessions when JWT user doesn't exist
- Graceful error handling that doesn't log expected auth errors
- Only fetch profiles when there's a valid session

### 2. Updated Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Added session validation before profile fetching
- Handle "user_not_found" errors gracefully
- Allow access to login/register pages when no profile exists
- Better error handling for expected auth states

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Distinguish between expected auth errors and system errors
- Don't log JWT-related errors that are expected during login flow
- Clear invalid sessions automatically

## Testing
- Created test script to verify login page functionality
- Confirmed Supabase client works correctly
- Verified auth state handling for fresh sessions
- Confirmed database access is properly restricted

## User Instructions
If users still see JWT errors after this fix:

1. **Clear Browser Storage**:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage tab
   - Clear Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies for the site

2. **Use Incognito/Private Window**:
   - This provides a clean session without cached auth data

3. **The errors are expected** after clearing the database while browser sessions exist

## Files Modified
- `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Enhanced auth state management
- `middleware.ts` - Improved session validation
- `scripts/test-login-page.js` - Test script for verification
- `scripts/clear-browser-auth.js` - User instructions for clearing auth data

## Result
- Login page now loads without errors
- Auth context handles invalid JWT tokens gracefully
- Middleware properly validates sessions
- Users can access login/register pages normally
- System automatically clears invalid sessions
