# Readiness Context Navigation Fix

## Issue
After implementing task 10 (integrating ReadinessProvider at project layout level), the application was throwing an error on load:

```
Error: useReadiness must be used within a ReadinessProvider
at useReadiness (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./lib/contexts/readiness-context.tsx:416:15)
at useFeatureAvailability (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./hooks/use-feature-availability.ts:20:131)
at NavigationProvider (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./components/navigation/navigation-provider.tsx:28:134)
```

## Root Cause
The `NavigationProvider` component was calling `useFeatureAvailability()` which internally calls `useReadiness()`, but the `NavigationProvider` is used at the app layout level, outside of any `ReadinessProvider` context.

The issue occurred because:
1. `NavigationProvider` is used globally in the app layout
2. `ReadinessProvider` is only wrapped around individual project detail layouts
3. The navigation system was trying to access project-specific readiness data globally

## Solution
Modified the `useFeatureAvailability` hook to gracefully handle cases where it's called outside of a `ReadinessProvider` context:

### Before (Problematic)
```typescript
export function useFeatureAvailability(projectId: string) {
  const { readiness, isLoading: loading, error } = useReadiness() // Always throws if no context
  // ...
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
export function useFeatureAvailability(projectId: string) {
  // Try to use readiness context, but handle cases where it's not available
  let readiness = null
  let loading = false
  let error = null
  
  try {
    const readinessContext = useReadiness()
    readiness = readinessContext.readiness
    loading = readinessContext.isLoading
    error = readinessContext.error
  } catch (contextError) {
    // If we're outside of ReadinessProvider context, use fallback behavior
    if (contextError instanceof Error && contextError.message.includes('useReadiness must be used within a ReadinessProvider')) {
      // Return default unavailable features when no context is available
      loading = false
      error = null
      readiness = null
    } else {
      // Re-throw other errors
      throw contextError
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Behavior Changes

### When Used Within ReadinessProvider Context (Project Pages)
- Works exactly as before
- Uses cached readiness data for optimal performance
- All features work based on actual project readiness

### When Used Outside ReadinessProvider Context (Navigation, etc.)
- Gracefully falls back to default behavior
- All features return as "unavailable" with appropriate guidance messages
- No errors thrown, navigation continues to work
- Loading state is false, error is null

### Error Handling
- Context-specific errors are caught and handled gracefully
- Other errors are re-thrown as expected
- Maintains proper error boundaries

## Testing
Added comprehensive tests in `hooks/__tests__/use-feature-availability-context.test.tsx`:

1. ✅ Works when used within ReadinessProvider context
2. ✅ Gracefully handles being used outside ReadinessProvider context  
3. ✅ Re-throws non-context errors appropriately
4. ✅ Handles loading state from context
5. ✅ Handles error state from context

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes the navigation error on app load
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality within project contexts
- ✅ Provides graceful degradation outside project contexts
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass

## Files Modified
- `hooks/use-feature-availability.ts` - Added context error handling
- `hooks/__tests__/use-feature-availability-context.test.tsx` - Added comprehensive tests

This fix ensures that the readiness performance optimization (task 10) works correctly while maintaining compatibility with the global navigation system.
