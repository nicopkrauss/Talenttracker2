# Approve Tab Enhancements - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The approve tab in the timecards page has been significantly enhanced to provide administrators with comprehensive timecard review capabilities, including proper display of multi-day timecards, admin notes, and detailed time breakdowns.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Header Information
- **User and Project Display**: Clear identification of the timecard submitter and associated project
- **Period Information**: Shows date range for multi-day timecards vs single date for single-day timecards
- **Submission Timestamp**: Displays when the timecard was submitted for review
- **Navigation Counter**: Shows current position (e.g., "3 of 11") in the approval queue

### 2. Admin Notes Display
- **Prominent Visibility**: Admin notes are displayed in a dedicated blue-highlighted card
- **Full Text Display**: Complete admin notes with proper whitespace preservation
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows when admin notes are present
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Uses distinct styling to draw attention to important notes

### 3. Enhanced Time Summary
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Total hours, break duration, pay rate, and total pay
- **Multi-Day Averages**: For multi-day timecards, shows averages per day:
  - Average hours per day
  - Average break duration per day  
  - Average pay per day
- **Visual Emphasis**: Large, clear typography for key financial information

### 4. Multi-Day Timecard Support
- **Full Daily Breakdown**: Uses the `MultiDayTimecardDisplay` component to show all working days
- **Expandable Interface**: Users can expand to see details for all days in multi-day timecards
- **Day-by-Day Details**: Each day shows:
  - Check-in and check-out times
  - Break start and end times (or "No break taken")
  - Hours worked and daily pay
- **Visual Separation**: Clear dividers between days for easy reading

### 5. Enhanced Navigation Controls
- **Previous/Next Buttons**: Navigate through submitted timecards
- **Approve Button**: Large, prominent green button for approval
- **Reject Button**: Red-outlined button for rejections (placeholder for future implementation)
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during approval operations
- **Disabled States**: Proper button states when at beginning/end of queue

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure Support
The approve tab now properly handles the normalized timecard structure:

```typescript
interface TimecardForApproval {
  // Header information
  id: string
  user_id: string
  project_id: string
  status: 'submitted'
  
  // Period information
  period_start_date: string
  period_end_date: string
  
  // Totals
  total_hours: number
  total_break_duration: number
  total_pay: number
  pay_rate: number
  
  // Admin information
  admin_notes?: string
  submitted_at?: string
  
  // Multi-day support
  is_multi_day: boolean
  working_days: number
  daily_entries: DailyEntry[]
  
  // Relations
  profiles: { full_name: string }
  projects: { name: string }
}
```

### Component Integration
