# Authentication Sign Out Error Fix

## Problem
When users signed out of the application, they encountered the error:
```
Error: Authentication validation failed
at fetchProjects (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./components/projects/project-hub.tsx:59:23)
```

## Root Cause
The `ProjectHub` component was making API calls to `/api/projects` on component mount without checking if the user was authenticated. When a user signed out:

1. The auth context cleared the user state
2. The `ProjectHub` component remained mounted and continued to make API calls
3. The API route `/api/projects` required authentication and returned a 401 error
4. This caused the "Authentication validation failed" error

## Solution
Modified the `ProjectHub` component to:

1. **Import and use the auth context**:
   ```typescript
   import { useAuth } from "@/lib/auth-context"
   
   const { isAuthenticated, user } = useAuth()
   ```

2. **Add authentication checks in fetchProjects**:
   ```typescript
   const fetchProjects = async (showRefreshIndicator = false) => {
     // Don't fetch if user is not authenticated
     if (!isAuthenticated || !user) {
       setLoading(false)
       setRefreshing(false)
       return
     }
     // ... rest of fetch logic
   }
   ```

3. **Update useEffect dependencies**:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     fetchProjects()
   }, [isAuthenticated, user]) // Added auth dependencies
   ```

4. **Add early return for unauthenticated state**:
   ```typescript
   // Don't render if user is not authenticated
   if (!isAuthenticated || !user) {
     return (
       <div className="space-y-6">
         {/* Show sign-in message */}
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

5. **Updated projects page to use auth context**:
   ```typescript
   const { userProfile, isAuthenticated, loading } = useAuth()
   const userRole: UserRole = userProfile?.role || 'escort'
   
   if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />
   if (!isAuthenticated) {
     router.push('/login')
     return <LoadingSpinner />
   }
   ```

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests in `components/projects/__tests__/project-hub-auth-fix.test.tsx` that verify:

- ✅ No API calls are made when user is not authenticated
- ✅ API calls are made when user is authenticated  
- ✅ Component handles authentication state changes properly

## Files Modified
- `components/projects/project-hub.tsx` - Added authentication checks
- `app/(app)/projects/page.tsx` - Updated to use auth context
- `components/projects/__tests__/project-hub-auth-fix.test.tsx` - Added tests

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminates authentication errors on sign out
- ✅ Improves user experience with proper loading states
- ✅ Prevents unnecessary API calls when not authenticated
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality for authenticated users

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Authentication-aware components**: Components that make API calls should check authentication state
2. **Proper dependency management**: useEffect dependencies include authentication state
3. **Graceful degradation**: Show appropriate messages for unauthenticated users
4. **Early returns**: Prevent unnecessary operations when conditions aren't met
5. **Comprehensive testing**: Test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
