# Fake Timecards Setup Guide

This guide explains how to populate your database with fake timecards to test the enhanced approval interface.

## üìã What Will Be Created

The fake timecards will include:

### Status Variety
- **DRAFT**: Timecards not yet submitted (~30%)
- **SUBMITTED**: Timecards pending approval (~30%) 
- **APPROVED**: Already approved timecards (~25%)
- **REJECTED**: Rejected timecards with comments (~15%)

### Special Conditions
- **Manually Edited**: Some timecards flagged as manually edited (~25%)
- **Comments**: Supervisor comments for rejected and edited timecards
- **Various Pay Rates**: Different hourly rates based on roles
  - Talent Escort: $25/hr
  - Supervisor: $35/hr
  - Coordinator: $30/hr
- **Realistic Schedules**: Work hours with breaks over the past 7 days

## üöÄ Method 1: SQL Database Insert (Recommended)

### Step 1: Use the Generated SQL Script
The script `temp_timecards.sql` has been created with comprehensive fake timecard data.

### Step 2: Run in Supabase SQL Editor
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `temp_timecards.sql`
4. Click \"Run\" to execute

### Step 3: Verify Creation
The script will show a summary of created timecards by status.

## üñ•Ô∏è Method 2: Node.js Script (Alternative)

### Option A: Using Supabase Client
```bash
# Requires SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable
node scripts/create-fake-timecards.js
```

### Option B: Using Prisma
```bash
# Uses Prisma client with raw SQL
node scripts/create-fake-timecards-prisma.js
```

## üß™ Testing the Enhanced Features

Once you have fake timecards, you can test:

### ‚úÖ Role-Based Permissions
- Log in with different roles (admin, supervisor, talent_escort)
- Verify appropriate access levels
- Test permission error messages

### ‚úÖ Required Rejection Comments
- Try to reject a timecard without comments
- Verify validation error appears
- Add comments and successfully reject

### ‚úÖ Bulk Approval with Validation
- Select multiple timecards
- Click \"Approve X Timecards\"
- Verify confirmation dialog shows:
  - Total count
  - Manually edited warnings
  - Invalid status warnings

### ‚úÖ Two-Way Confirmation for Edits
- As an admin, click \"Edit\" on a timecard
- Make changes and add required admin note
- Verify timecard returns to \"submitted\" status

### ‚úÖ Manual Edit Flagging
- Look for \"Manually Edited\" badges on timecards
- Verify warnings appear in bulk operations
- Check that comments explain the edits

## üìä Expected Test Data

### Timecard Distribution
```
STATUS BREAKDOWN:
- DRAFT: ~7-8 timecards
- SUBMITTED: ~7-8 timecards (perfect for testing approvals)
- APPROVED: ~6-7 timecards
- REJECTED: ~3-4 timecards
- MANUALLY EDITED: ~6-7 timecards (flagged for attention)
```

### Realistic Data Features
- **Work Hours**: 8-10 AM start times, 4-7 PM end times
- **Break Times**: 12-2 PM start, 30-60 minute durations
- **Pay Calculations**: Accurate total hours and pay calculations
- **Comments**: Contextual supervisor comments
- **Timestamps**: Proper submitted_at, approved_at dates

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Timecard List
- Navigate to `/timecards`
- Verify you see timecards in different statuses
- Look for \"Manually Edited\" badges

### 2. Test Approval Queue
- Click \"Approvals\" tab
- Should see submitted timecards
- Verify manually edited warnings appear

### 3. Test Permission System
- Log in as different roles
- Verify appropriate access levels
- Test permission error messages

### 4. Test Bulk Operations
- Select multiple timecards
- Test bulk approval confirmation
- Verify validation warnings

## üö® Troubleshooting

### No Timecards Appear
- Check if users exist with roles: talent_escort, supervisor, coordinator
- Verify at least one project exists with status 'active'
- Check database permissions and RLS policies
- Look for console errors in browser

### Permission Errors
- Verify user roles are set correctly in profiles table
- Check that users have status = 'active'
- Ensure system_settings table has approval permissions configured

### SQL Script Errors
- Ensure the timecards table exists with all required columns
- Check that profiles and projects tables have data
- Verify foreign key constraints are properly set up

## üéØ Success Criteria

You'll know the setup is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Timecards appear in the list with various statuses
2. ‚úÖ \"Approvals\" tab shows submitted timecards
3. ‚úÖ Manually edited flags are visible with warning badges
4. ‚úÖ Permission system works for different roles
5. ‚úÖ Bulk approval shows confirmation dialog with warnings
6. ‚úÖ Rejection requires comments and shows validation
7. ‚úÖ Edit functionality works for admins with proper workflow

## üìù Next Steps

After setting up fake timecards:

1. **Test All Features**: Go through each requirement systematically
2. **User Acceptance Testing**: Have different users test the interface
3. **Performance Testing**: Test with larger datasets if needed
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify with notification system
5. **Documentation**: Update user guides based on testing feedback

The enhanced approval interface is now ready for comprehensive testing! üéâ

## üîß Additional Scripts

### Clear All Timecards
```sql
DELETE FROM timecards;
```

### Check Current Timecard Count
```sql
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE manually_edited) as manually_edited_count
FROM timecards 
GROUP BY status;
```

### View Sample Timecards
```sql
SELECT 
  t.*,
  p.full_name as user_name,
  pr.name as project_name
FROM timecards t
JOIN profiles p ON t.user_id = p.id
JOIN projects pr ON t.project_id = pr.id
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
