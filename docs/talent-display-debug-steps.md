# Talent Display Debug Steps

## Issue
After fixing the optimistic state timing, no talent are appearing in the "Current Talent Assignments" section.

## Debug Steps Added

### 1. Added Debug Logging
I've added temporary debug logging to help identify the issue:

**In the browser console, look for:**
- `üîç [DEBUG] Roster API response:` - Shows the API response data
- `üîç [DEBUG] Setting assigned talent: X items` - Shows how many items are being set
- `üîç [OPTIMISTIC DEBUG] Sync check:` - Shows optimistic state sync behavior

### 2. What to Check

1. **Open browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. **Refresh the page** and look for the debug messages
3. **Check these specific things:**

#### API Response Check
```
üîç [DEBUG] Roster API response: {...}
```
- Is the API returning data?
- Is the data structure correct?
- Are there any API errors?

#### Data Setting Check
```
üîç [DEBUG] Setting assigned talent: X items
```
- Is this showing the correct number of items?
- Is it showing 0 items when you expect more?

#### Optimistic State Sync Check
```
üîç [OPTIMISTIC DEBUG] Sync check: {...}
```
- Is `allowSync` true?
- Is `initialDataLength` correct?
- Is the sync happening?

### 3. Likely Issues

Based on the changes made, the most likely issues are:

1. **Initial Sync Not Happening**: The optimistic state isn't syncing with server data on initial load
2. **Server Data Not Loading**: The API calls are failing or returning empty data
3. **State Setting Issue**: The server state isn't being set correctly

### 4. Quick Fixes to Try

If you see the issue in the console logs:

#### If API is returning empty data:
- Check if there's actually assigned talent in the database
- Verify the project ID is correct

#### If optimistic state isn't syncing:
- The debug logs will show if sync conditions are being met
- May need to adjust the sync logic further

#### If server state isn't being set:
- Check if `setServerAssignedTalent` is being called with the right data

### 5. Temporary Workaround

If needed, you can temporarily force a sync by adding this to the browser console:
```javascript
// Force refresh the talent data
window.location.reload()
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check the console logs** first
2. **Share the debug output** so I can see exactly what's happening
3. **I'll fix the specific issue** based on what the logs show

The debug logging will help us pinpoint exactly where the data flow is breaking.
