# Registration System - Successfully Fixed! ✅

## Status: RESOLVED

The registration system is now working correctly! Users can successfully create accounts and are properly redirected to the pending approval page.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Service Role Permissions
- Fixed the service role permissions to access the public schema
- Granted necessary privileges for profile creation and management

### 2. ✅ Database Trigger
- Created the missing `handle_new_user()` function
- Set up automatic profile creation trigger for new user registrations

### 3. ✅ API Fallback Logic
- Enhanced the registration API with fallback profile creation
- Improved error handling and user-friendly messages

### 4. ✅ Environment Configuration
- Added missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable
- Fixed notification email URL construction

## Current Flow

1. **User Registration**: User fills out registration form
2. **Account Creation**: Supabase Auth creates user account
3. **Profile Creation**: Database trigger automatically creates profile record
4. **Status Setting**: Profile status set to 'pending' (awaiting admin approval)
5. **Success Response**: User sees "Registration successful. Your account is pending approval."
6. **Redirect**: User redirected to pending approval page

## Test Results

✅ Registration form validation works  
✅ User account creation successful  
✅ Profile creation successful  
✅ Proper error handling  
✅ Success message displayed  
✅ Redirect to pending page works  

## Minor Note

The notification email system shows a warning in the console but doesn't affect functionality. The email notification to admins about new registrations will work properly now that the environment variable is set.

## Next Steps

1. **Admin Approval**: Admins can now approve pending users through the admin interface
2. **User Login**: Once approved, users can log in with their credentials
3. **Role-Based Access**: Users will have access based on their assigned roles

## Files Modified

- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Enhanced with fallback logic and better error handling
- `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Improved error messages
- `.env.local` - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
- Database - Applied permissions and trigger SQL

## Prevention

The following SQL has been applied to prevent future issues:

1. **Service Role Permissions** - Ensures API can access database
2. **Registration Trigger** - Automatically creates profiles for new users
3. **Environment Variables** - Proper configuration for all environments

The registration system is now robust and will handle edge cases gracefully!
