# Role-Based Timecard Routing Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of task 4 from the project-based timecard navigation spec: "Modify main timecards page for role-based routing".

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Imports**
   - Added `useRouter` from Next.js navigation
   - Added `TimecardProjectHub` component import
   - Added `useAuth` from auth context
   - Added `hasAdminAccess` from role utilities

2. **Authentication Integration**
   - Replaced temporary mock auth with real `useAuth` hook
   - Added proper authentication state management
   - Added loading state handling for authentication

3. **Role-Based Logic**
   - Added `shouldShowProjectHub` computed value based on admin access
   - Implemented conditional rendering based on user role
   - Added project selection handler for navigation

4. **Navigation Handler**
   - Added `handleSelectProject` function to navigate to project-specific timecard views
   - Routes to `/timecards/project/{projectId}` when project is selected

### Code Structure

```typescript
// Determine if user should see project selection interface
const shouldShowProjectHub = useMemo(() => 
  isAdmin, 
  [isAdmin]
)

// Handle project selection from TimecardProjectHub
const handleSelectProject = useCallback((projectId: string) => {
  router.push(`/timecards/project/${projectId}`)
}, [router])
```

### Conditional Rendering

The page now renders different interfaces based on user role:

- **Admin/In-House Users**: See the `TimecardProjectHub` component for project selection
- **Regular Users**: See the existing timecard interface with breakdown/approve/summary tabs

### Authentication Flow

1. Shows loading skeleton while authentication is loading
2. Redirects to login if user is not authenticated
3. Renders appropriate interface based on user role

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **1.1**: Admin users see project selection interface instead of direct timecard list
✅ **3.1**: Role-based routing implemented using `hasAdminAccess` utility
✅ **3.2**: Regular users maintain existing timecard list behavior
✅ **7.1**: Proper loading states added for both authentication and data loading
✅ **7.3**: Backward compatibility maintained - existing functionality preserved

## Testing

The implementation:
- ✅ Compiles successfully with TypeScript
- ✅ Builds without errors
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality for non-admin users
- ✅ Integrates with existing authentication system
- ✅ Uses proper role-based access control

## Next Steps

This implementation sets up the foundation for:
1. Creating project-specific timecard pages (task 5)
2. Adding project access validation to APIs (task 7)
3. Implementing comprehensive testing (task 9)

The role-based routing is now complete and ready for users to test the project selection workflow.
