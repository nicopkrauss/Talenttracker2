# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The authentication UI system provides user registration, login, and account approval workflows for the Talent Tracker application. The system must handle public sign-up, pending approval states, admin approval queues, and secure authentication flows while maintaining a clean, simple design consistent with the existing application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with my basic information, so that I can request access to the Talent Tracker system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN displaying the registration form THEN the system SHALL request Full Name, Email, Password, Contact Phone Number, and Location (City, State) in logical order
3. WHEN the user submits the form THEN the system SHALL require agreement to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy via checkbox
4. WHEN the Privacy Policy text is displayed THEN the system SHALL make it a clickable hyperlink
5. WHEN the user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create an account in "Pending Approval" state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with a pending account, I want to see a clear status message, so that I understand my account is awaiting approval and cannot access the application yet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with pending status logs in THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen message: "Your account has been created and is awaiting approval from an administrator. You will be notified when your account is active."
2. WHEN displaying the pending approval message THEN the system SHALL prevent access to any other part of the application
3. WHEN a user's account status is pending THEN the system SHALL not display navigation or other application features
4. WHEN a pending user attempts to access protected routes THEN the system SHALL redirect to the pending approval screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log in with my credentials, so that I can access the Talent Tracker application based on my role and approval status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the login page THEN the system SHALL display email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect based on account status
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN an approved user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate default page based on their role
5. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL establish a secure session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to see and manage pending user approvals, so that I can control who has access to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the Team module THEN the system SHALL display a "Pending Approval" queue section
2. WHEN displaying pending approvals THEN the system SHALL show user information including name, email, and registration date
3. WHEN an admin selects one or multiple users THEN the system SHALL provide bulk approval functionality
4. WHEN an admin approves users THEN the system SHALL change their status to "Active" and send notifications
5. WHEN users are approved THEN the system SHALL send notification: "Welcome to Talent Tracker! Your account has been approved and is now active."

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication interface to match the application's design, so that I have a consistent and professional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying authentication forms THEN the system SHALL use the same design patterns as the talent page
2. WHEN rendering form elements THEN the system SHALL use shadcn/ui components for consistency
3. WHEN displaying authentication pages THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design for mobile and desktop
4. WHEN showing error states THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and messaging patterns
5. WHEN loading or processing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states and feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure password handling and form validation, so that my account information is protected and I receive clear feedback on any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL mask the password input
2. WHEN validating forms THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
3. WHEN form submission fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL use secure practices for password transmission
