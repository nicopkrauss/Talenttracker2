# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves systematically renaming all references to "Talent Logistics Coordinator" throughout the application and database to simply "Coordinator". This includes updating database enums, display names, documentation, test files, and all user-facing text while maintaining backward compatibility and data integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want to see "Coordinator" instead of "Talent Logistics Coordinator" in all user interfaces, so that the role name is more concise and easier to read.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any user interface element THEN the system SHALL display "Coordinator" instead of "Talent Logistics Coordinator"
2. WHEN I see role selection dropdowns THEN the system SHALL show "Coordinator" as an option
3. WHEN I view team assignments THEN the system SHALL display "Coordinator" for the role
4. WHEN I see navigation elements THEN the system SHALL use "Coordinator" in role-based navigation descriptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to use "coordinator" instead of "talent_logistics_coordinator" for the enum value, so that the codebase is consistent with the new naming convention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema is updated THEN the system SHALL use "coordinator" as the enum value in project_role
2. WHEN the database schema is updated THEN the system SHALL use "coordinator" as the enum value in system_role  
3. WHEN existing data is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing role assignments and data integrity
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have no references to "talent_logistics_coordinator" in the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code references to use the new "coordinator" naming, so that the codebase is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code references roles THEN the system SHALL use "coordinator" instead of "talent_logistics_coordinator"
2. WHEN display name functions are called THEN the system SHALL return "Coordinator" for the coordinator role
3. WHEN role utilities are used THEN the system SHALL handle "coordinator" as the role identifier
4. WHEN TypeScript types are defined THEN the system SHALL use "coordinator" in type definitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all documentation and comments to reflect the new naming, so that the codebase documentation is accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is reviewed THEN the system SHALL use "Coordinator" in all user-facing documentation
2. WHEN code comments are reviewed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate naming in technical comments
3. WHEN API documentation is reviewed THEN the system SHALL reflect the new role naming
4. WHEN steering files are reviewed THEN the system SHALL use the updated role names

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to use the new naming convention, so that tests accurately reflect the current system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are executed THEN the system SHALL use "coordinator" in test data and assertions
2. WHEN test descriptions are reviewed THEN the system SHALL use "Coordinator" in human-readable test names
3. WHEN mock data is generated THEN the system SHALL use the new role naming
4. WHEN test utilities are used THEN the system SHALL handle the coordinator role correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the migration to be safe and reversible, so that I can confidently deploy the changes without risk of data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is executed THEN the system SHALL create a backup of affected data
2. WHEN the migration encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback instructions
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity
4. WHEN a rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a clear rollback procedure
