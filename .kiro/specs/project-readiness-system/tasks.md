  - Add keyboard accessibility and responsive design for mobile
  - _Requirements: 4_

- [x] 4. Create Info Tab Dashboard





  - Build InfoTabDashboard component with collapsible project status section
  - Implement prioritized todo list with Critical (red), Important (yellow), and Optional (blue) items
  - Add completed setup section showing finalized areas
  - Create assignment progress summary with urgent issue highlighting
  - Add navigation buttons that direct to specific tabs for each guidance item
  - _Requirements: 2, 7_

- [x] 5. Update Info Tab Layout and Add Finalization





  - Make Info tab sections (description, locations) collapsible with dashboard at top
  - Add finalization buttons to Roles & Team and Talent Roster tab headers
  - Connect finalization buttons to API endpoints with confirmation dialogs
  - Update section styling for consistency across all tabs
  - Test collapsible functionality and finalization workflow
  - _Requirements: 2, 5_

- [x] 6. Create useProjectReadiness Hook and Real-Time Updates


  - Create useProjectReadiness custom hook with Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live readiness updates
  - Add optimistic updates for finalization actions with proper error handling and rollback
  - Implement real-time synchronization across multiple browser tabs and user sessions
  - Test real-time updates when project data changes (locations, roles, team, talent)
  - _Requirements: 6_

- [x] 7. Update Empty States with Guidance Messages





  - Update empty states in Talent Roster tab with guidance messages and navigation buttons
  - Update empty states in Roles & Team tab with actionable guidance for staff assignment
  - Update empty states in Assignments tab with clear next steps for assignment creation
  - Add contextual guidance in Settings tab for project configuration
  - Ensure all guidance messages include navigation buttons that lead to relevant sections
  - _Requirements: 2, 3_

- [x] 8. Implement Feature Availability Checks Throughout App





  - Add feature availability checks to time tracking components (require staff assigned)
  - Add feature availability checks to assignment components (require talent and escorts)
  - Add feature availability checks to location tracking (require locations and assignments)
  - Update navigation and menu items to show/hide based on feature availability
  - Add contextual guidance messages when features are unavailable with clear next steps
  - _Requirements: 3_

- [x] 9. Performance Optimization and Caching





  - Optimize database queries for readiness calculations with proper indexes
  - Implement caching for readiness data with 30-second TTL as specified in design
  - Add lazy loading for dashboard components to improve initial load time
  - Optimize bundle size by code-splitting mode-specific components
  - Ensure dashboard loads within 200ms and mode switching is instantaneous
  - _Requirements: Performance requirements_

- [x] 10. Comprehensive Testing and Validation





  - Write unit tests for readiness calculation logic and feature availability engine
  - Write component tests for dashboard, mode toggle, and finalization workflows
  - Write integration tests for all readiness API endpoints with various project states
  - Write end-to-end tests for complete readiness workflow from setup to finalization
  - Test real-time updates across multiple browser sessions
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation through testing_

- [ ] 11. Production Deployment and Documentation
  - Deploy database migration to staging environment and validate with production-like data
  - Deploy backend API changes and frontend components to production
  - Create user documentation for new readiness system and migration guide
  - Monitor system performance and error rates after deployment
  - Collect user feedback and address any critical issues discovered
  - _Requirements: 8_
