# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Talent Tracker application currently uses hardcoded color classes throughout its components, which prevents proper theme switching between light and dark modes. This feature will systematically replace all hardcoded color references with theme-aware CSS custom properties and Tailwind utility classes to ensure consistent theming across the entire application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to properly support both light and dark themes, so that I can use the interface comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between light and dark themes THEN all text colors SHALL adapt appropriately to maintain proper contrast ratios
2. WHEN I switch between light and dark themes THEN all background colors SHALL change to match the selected theme
3. WHEN I switch between light and dark themes THEN all border and accent colors SHALL update consistently
4. WHEN viewing any page in dark mode THEN text SHALL remain readable with proper contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to use semantic color tokens instead of hardcoded values, so that theme changes are consistent and maintainable across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing component code THEN hardcoded color classes like `text-gray-600` SHALL be replaced with semantic tokens like `text-muted-foreground`
2. WHEN reviewing component code THEN hardcoded background classes like `bg-gray-50` SHALL be replaced with theme-aware classes like `bg-muted`
3. WHEN adding new components THEN developers SHALL use only theme-aware color tokens
4. WHEN semantic colors are needed (success, warning, error) THEN they SHALL include both light and dark mode variants

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want semantic colors (success, warning, error, info) to be clearly distinguishable in both light and dark themes, so that I can quickly understand the status and meaning of different UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing success states THEN green colors SHALL be visible and accessible in both light and dark themes
2. WHEN viewing warning states THEN amber/yellow colors SHALL be visible and accessible in both light and dark themes  
3. WHEN viewing error states THEN red colors SHALL be visible and accessible in both light and dark themes
4. WHEN viewing informational states THEN blue colors SHALL be visible and accessible in both light and dark themes
5. WHEN using semantic colors THEN they SHALL maintain at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio against their backgrounds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interactive elements (buttons, links, form inputs) to have proper focus and hover states in both themes, so that I can navigate the interface effectively using keyboard or mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN focusing on interactive elements THEN focus indicators SHALL be visible in both light and dark themes
2. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN hover states SHALL provide clear visual feedback in both themes
3. WHEN interacting with form elements THEN border and background colors SHALL respond appropriately to state changes
4. WHEN elements are disabled THEN they SHALL appear visually disabled with appropriate opacity in both themes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audit of all existing components, so that no hardcoded colors are missed during the migration to theme-aware tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting the audit THEN all React components SHALL be scanned for hardcoded color classes
2. WHEN conducting the audit THEN all CSS files SHALL be scanned for hardcoded color values
3. WHEN conducting the audit THEN a prioritized list of components SHALL be created based on usage frequency
4. WHEN the audit is complete THEN a migration checklist SHALL be available for systematic implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want automated tests to verify theme consistency, so that regressions in theme support can be caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN components SHALL be tested in both light and dark themes
2. WHEN running tests THEN color contrast ratios SHALL be validated programmatically
3. WHEN running tests THEN theme switching SHALL be verified to work without visual artifacts
4. WHEN tests fail THEN specific color issues SHALL be clearly identified in test output
