# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The authentication system overhaul involves completely removing all existing authentication logic and reimplementing a clean, secure authentication system from scratch. This includes removing all current auth-related code, database structures, Supabase configurations, and then building a new system that handles user registration, login, role-based access control, and admin approval workflows. The new system must be secure, maintainable, and aligned with the project's architecture standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to completely remove all existing authentication code and configurations, so that I can start with a clean slate and avoid conflicts with the new implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing authentication code THEN the system SHALL remove all auth-related React components and hooks
2. WHEN cleaning up authentication THEN the system SHALL remove all auth-related API routes and middleware
3. WHEN preserving database THEN the system SHALL keep existing database tables and only update RLS policies if necessary
4. WHEN reviewing auth configurations THEN the system SHALL audit current Supabase Auth settings and reconfigure only if needed
5. WHEN cleaning up dependencies THEN the system SHALL remove unused authentication packages from package.json
6. WHEN removing auth logic THEN the system SHALL update all protected routes to temporarily allow access during development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a new Supabase authentication configuration, so that I have a clean foundation for implementing user authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Supabase Auth THEN the system SHALL enable email/password authentication only
2. WHEN setting up auth providers THEN the system SHALL disable all social login providers initially
3. WHEN configuring email settings THEN the system SHALL set up proper email templates for confirmation and password reset
4. WHEN setting auth policies THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate session timeout and security settings
5. WHEN establishing auth flow THEN the system SHALL set up proper redirect URLs for the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to audit and preserve the existing database schema while ensuring it works with the new authentication system, so that I don't lose existing data and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing database THEN the system SHALL review existing profiles table structure and confirm compatibility
2. WHEN checking relationships THEN the system SHALL verify existing foreign keys and constraints are properly configured
3. WHEN reviewing security THEN the system SHALL audit existing Row Level Security policies and update if needed
4. WHEN preserving data THEN the system SHALL ensure existing user profiles and role assignments remain intact
5. WHEN integrating auth THEN the system SHALL ensure new authentication code works with existing database schema
6. WHEN updating policies THEN the system SHALL only modify RLS policies if required for new auth implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with proper validation, so that I can request access to the system securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses registration THEN the system SHALL display a clean registration form
2. WHEN submitting registration THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (name, email, password, phone, location)
3. WHEN processing registration THEN the system SHALL create both Supabase auth user and profile record
4. WHEN creating account THEN the system SHALL set initial status to "pending" for admin approval
5. WHEN registration completes THEN the system SHALL redirect to pending approval page
6. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear, specific error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my credentials and be redirected appropriately, so that I can access the application based on my account status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing login page THEN the system SHALL display email and password fields with proper validation
2. WHEN submitting valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate through Supabase Auth
3. WHEN login succeeds THEN the system SHALL check user profile status and redirect accordingly
4. WHEN user status is pending THEN the system SHALL redirect to pending approval page
5. WHEN user status is active THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate dashboard based on role
6. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without revealing system details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage user approvals through a clean interface, so that I can control system access efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin accesses user management THEN the system SHALL display pending users in a clear table format
2. WHEN viewing pending users THEN the system SHALL show name, email, registration date, and contact information
3. WHEN selecting users THEN the system SHALL provide individual and bulk approval options
4. WHEN approving users THEN the system SHALL update status to "active" and send notification email
5. WHEN approval completes THEN the system SHALL remove users from pending queue and update UI
6. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter capabilities for large lists

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper role-based access control, so that users can only access features appropriate to their assigned roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing RBAC THEN the system SHALL create middleware to check user roles on protected routes
2. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL verify both authentication status and role assignments
3. WHEN accessing features THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based restrictions at both UI and API levels
4. WHEN role changes occur THEN the system SHALL update user sessions and permissions immediately
5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate error or login page

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement secure session management, so that user authentication is maintained properly across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user logs in THEN the system SHALL establish secure session with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to login page
3. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data and redirect to public page
4. WHEN session is active THEN the system SHALL refresh tokens automatically before expiration
5. WHEN implementing sessions THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTP-only cookies where possible
6. WHEN handling session errors THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling and recovery

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper error handling and logging, so that authentication issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN displaying errors to users THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly messages without exposing system details
3. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error response formats
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting and security measures
5. WHEN logging auth events THEN the system SHALL track login attempts, registrations, and approval actions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create comprehensive tests for the authentication system, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all auth utility functions
2. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for auth forms and flows
3. WHEN testing API routes THEN the system SHALL include tests for all authentication endpoints
4. WHEN testing security THEN the system SHALL include tests for role-based access control
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL include tests for error conditions and invalid inputs
