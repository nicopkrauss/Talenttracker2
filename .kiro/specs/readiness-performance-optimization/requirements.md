# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current project readiness system provides valuable user experience benefits by preventing access to incomplete features and guiding users through proper setup workflows. However, the implementation creates significant performance overhead through excessive API calls, with every component that needs feature availability information triggering separate readiness checks. This optimization will maintain all current UX benefits while dramatically reducing API overhead through intelligent caching, event-driven invalidation, and client-side state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the readiness system to maintain current UX functionality while reducing API overhead, so that the application performs efficiently without sacrificing user guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads a project page THEN the system SHALL fetch readiness data once with the initial project data
2. WHEN readiness data is fetched THEN the system SHALL cache it on the client side for the duration of the session
3. WHEN multiple components need readiness information THEN the system SHALL use cached data instead of making additional API calls
4. WHEN readiness status changes due to user actions THEN the system SHALL update the cache optimistically
5. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh readiness data with the initial load

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want readiness calculations to be performed efficiently at the database level, so that API responses are fast and don't require complex client-side computation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN readiness is calculated THEN the system SHALL use database-level computed columns or materialized views
2. WHEN project dependencies change THEN the system SHALL automatically update readiness calculations via database triggers
3. WHEN readiness data is requested THEN the system SHALL return pre-calculated results instead of performing real-time calculations
4. WHEN the API returns readiness data THEN it SHALL include specific feature flags and blocking issues
5. WHEN readiness calculations are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency across all related tables

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user performing project setup actions, I want the interface to immediately reflect my changes without waiting for server validation, so that the experience feels responsive and fluid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a setup action THEN the system SHALL immediately update the UI to reflect the change
2. WHEN optimistic updates are applied THEN the system SHALL queue a background sync with the server
3. WHEN server sync completes THEN the system SHALL reconcile any differences between optimistic and actual state
4. WHEN server sync fails THEN the system SHALL revert optimistic changes and show appropriate error messaging
5. WHEN multiple users are working on the same project THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user working with other team members on project setup, I want to see real-time updates when others make changes that affect readiness, so that I have accurate information about project status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another user makes changes affecting readiness THEN the system SHALL receive real-time notifications via Supabase subscriptions
2. WHEN real-time updates are received THEN the system SHALL update the local cache and refresh affected UI components
3. WHEN real-time connection is lost THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and refetch data on reconnection
4. WHEN real-time updates conflict with local optimistic updates THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using server state as truth
5. WHEN real-time updates are received THEN the system SHALL batch multiple rapid updates to prevent UI thrashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the readiness system, I want clear separation between readiness calculation logic and UI presentation, so that the system is maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN readiness logic is implemented THEN it SHALL be separated into dedicated utility functions and hooks
2. WHEN components need readiness information THEN they SHALL use a centralized context provider
3. WHEN readiness rules change THEN they SHALL be configurable without requiring component modifications
4. WHEN testing readiness functionality THEN the system SHALL provide clear interfaces for mocking and testing different states
5. WHEN debugging readiness issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging and state inspection capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user navigating between project features, I want consistent performance regardless of how many readiness checks are required, so that the interface remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between project tabs THEN the system SHALL not trigger additional API calls for readiness data
2. WHEN components mount that require readiness information THEN they SHALL receive data synchronously from cache
3. WHEN readiness cache is empty THEN the system SHALL show loading states while fetching initial data
4. WHEN readiness data is stale THEN the system SHALL refresh it in the background without blocking UI interactions
5. WHEN the application is under heavy load THEN readiness checks SHALL not contribute to performance degradation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want all current readiness-based features to continue working exactly as they do now, so that the optimization doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN projects are in prep mode THEN the system SHALL continue to show appropriate empty states and guidance
2. WHEN setup checklist items are incomplete THEN the system SHALL continue to block access to dependent features
3. WHEN projects become ready for activation THEN the system SHALL continue to enable the finalization workflow
4. WHEN feature availability changes THEN the system SHALL continue to show/hide UI elements appropriately
5. WHEN users attempt to access unavailable features THEN the system SHALL continue to provide helpful guidance messages
