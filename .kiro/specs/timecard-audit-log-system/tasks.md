  # Timecard Audit Log System Implementation Plan

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] 1. Create audit log service foundation





  - Implement core AuditLogService class with change detection and recording methods
  - Create TypeScript interfaces for audit log entries, filters, and grouped entries
  - Add field name mapping constants and value formatting utilities
  - Write unit tests for audit log service methods
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8_

- [x] 2. Implement audit log API endpoints





  - Create GET /api/timecards/[id]/audit-logs route with authentication and authorization
  - Add query parameter validation for filtering, pagination, and grouping options
  - Implement proper error handling with standardized error responses
  - Add integration tests for API endpoints with various user roles and scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8_

- [x] 3. Integrate audit logging into timecard edit operations





  - Modify existing timecard edit APIs to detect field changes and record audit logs
  - Implement change detection logic that compares old and new timecard values
  - Add audit log recording for user edits in draft timecard operations
  - Ensure audit log creation happens within database transactions for data integrity
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.7, 1.8, 9.1, 9.3, 9.6_

- [x] 4. Implement audit logging for admin edit operations





  - Add audit log recording to admin timecard edit functionality with action_type "admin_edit"
  - Modify admin edit APIs to capture field changes before saving timecard data
  - Implement proper change_id generation for grouping related changes in single operations
  - Write tests to verify admin edit audit logs are created correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 6.1, 6.2, 9.3_

- [x] 5. Implement audit logging for rejection edit operations ✅ **FIXED**
  - ✅ Fixed rejection edit audit logging to meet specifications
  - ✅ Implemented proper change_id generation for grouping related field changes
  - ✅ Added correct field name mapping (check_in_time → check_in, etc.)
  - ✅ Only creates audit entries for fields that actually changed
  - ✅ Captures old_value from current timecard data and new_value from user input
  - ✅ Properly sets action_type to "rejection_edit" and includes work_date
  - ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for audit logic
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 9.1, 9.2_

- [x] 6. Create audit trail UI components





  - Build AuditTrailSection component that fetches and displays audit logs for a timecard
  - Implement AuditLogEntry component with proper styling for different action types
  - Create GroupedAuditEntry component for displaying related changes with collapsible interface
  - Add loading states, error handling, and empty state messaging to audit trail components
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8_

- [x] 7. Integrate audit trail into timecard details page





  - Add AuditTrailSection component to timecard details page below daily time breakdown
  - Implement proper responsive design and styling consistent with existing timecard UI
  - Add pagination or collapsible sections for handling large numbers of audit entries
  - Ensure audit trail section works correctly across different user roles and permissions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.6, 8.2, 8.3, 9.5_

- [ ] 8. Add basic tests for audit log functionality
  - Write unit tests for audit log service methods
  - Create integration tests for audit log API endpoints
  - Add component tests for audit trail UI display
  - Test all three audit log types (user_edit, admin_edit, rejection_edit)
  - _Requirements: Core functionality verification_
