# Timecard Audit Log System Requirements

## Introduction

The Talent Tracker application needs a comprehensive audit log system for timecard operations that tracks all changes made to timecard data, provides visibility into edit history, and ensures compliance with payroll auditing requirements. This system will capture detailed change information during different timecard states (draft, rejection, approval) and provide both API access and UI visibility for audit trails.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Audit Log Recording

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all timecard field changes to be automatically recorded with detailed context so that I have a complete audit trail for payroll compliance and dispute resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user edits any timecard field before submission THEN the system SHALL record an audit log entry with action_type "user_edit"
2. WHEN an administrator edits a timecard field during draft status THEN the system SHALL record an audit log entry with action_type "admin_edit"
3. WHEN an administrator edits a timecard field while rejecting it THEN the system SHALL record an audit log entry with action_type "rejection_edit"
4. WHEN recording audit entries THEN the system SHALL capture field_name, old_value, new_value, changed_by, changed_at, and work_date
5. WHEN multiple fields are changed in a single operation THEN each field change SHALL generate a separate audit log entry with the same change_id
6. WHEN audit log entries are created THEN they SHALL be linked to the specific timecard_id and user profile
7. WHEN timecard data is modified THEN the audit log SHALL be updated before the timecard data is saved
8. WHEN audit logging fails THEN the timecard modification SHALL be rolled back to maintain data integrity

### Requirement 2: Audit Log API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RESTful API endpoints for audit log data so that I can integrate audit trail functionality into the timecard management interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting audit logs for a timecard THEN the API SHALL provide GET /api/timecards/[id]/audit-logs endpoint
2. WHEN fetching audit logs THEN the response SHALL include all audit entries sorted by changed_at descending
3. WHEN fetching audit logs THEN each entry SHALL include user profile information (full_name) for the changed_by field
4. WHEN requesting audit logs THEN the API SHALL support pagination with limit and offset parameters
5. WHEN requesting audit logs THEN the API SHALL support filtering by action_type, field_name, and date range
6. WHEN unauthorized users request audit logs THEN the API SHALL return 403 Forbidden
7. WHEN audit logs are requested for non-existent timecards THEN the API SHALL return 404 Not Found
8. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and validation

### Requirement 3: Audit Log UI Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator reviewing timecards, I want to see the complete audit trail directly in the timecard details page so that I can understand all changes made to the timecard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a timecard details page THEN an "Audit Trail" section SHALL appear below the daily time breakdown
2. WHEN the audit trail is displayed THEN it SHALL show all changes in chronological order (most recent first)
3. WHEN displaying audit entries THEN each entry SHALL show the field name, old value, new value, who made the change, and when
4. WHEN displaying audit entries THEN different action types SHALL be visually distinguished with appropriate styling
5. WHEN audit entries reference user profiles THEN the full name SHALL be displayed instead of user IDs
6. WHEN there are many audit entries THEN the display SHALL support pagination or collapsible sections
7. WHEN no audit entries exist THEN the section SHALL display "No changes recorded" message
8. WHEN audit entries are loading THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be shown

### Requirement 4: Field-Level Change Tracking

**User Story:** As a payroll administrator, I want to see exactly which fields were changed and their before/after values so that I can verify the accuracy of timecard modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking check-in time changes THEN the audit log SHALL record the field as "check_in_time"
2. WHEN tracking check-out time changes THEN the audit log SHALL record the field as "check_out_time"
3. WHEN tracking break start time changes THEN the audit log SHALL record the field as "break_start_time"
4. WHEN tracking break end time changes THEN the audit log SHALL record the field as "break_end_time"
5. WHEN tracking total hours changes THEN the audit log SHALL record the field as "total_hours"
6. WHEN tracking break duration changes THEN the audit log SHALL record the field as "break_duration"
7. WHEN tracking status changes THEN the audit log SHALL record the field as "status"
8. WHEN recording time values THEN they SHALL be stored in ISO 8601 format for consistency
9. WHEN recording numeric values THEN they SHALL be stored with appropriate precision
10. WHEN fields are cleared (set to null) THEN the new_value SHALL be recorded as null

### Requirement 5: Contextual Action Type Classification

**User Story:** As an auditor, I want to understand the context of each change (user edit, admin edit, rejection edit) so that I can assess the appropriateness of modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user modifies their own draft timecard THEN the action_type SHALL be "user_edit"
2. WHEN an administrator modifies a draft timecard THEN the action_type SHALL be "admin_edit"
3. WHEN an administrator modifies fields while rejecting a timecard THEN the action_type SHALL be "rejection_edit"
4. WHEN displaying action types in the UI THEN they SHALL have distinct visual styling:
   - "user_edit" SHALL be styled with neutral colors
   - "admin_edit" SHALL be styled with warning colors
   - "rejection_edit" SHALL be styled with error colors
5. WHEN filtering audit logs THEN users SHALL be able to filter by specific action types
6. WHEN exporting audit data THEN action types SHALL be included in the export

### Requirement 6: Batch Change Tracking

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want related changes made in a single operation to be grouped together so that I can understand the scope of each modification session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple fields are changed in a single API request THEN they SHALL share the same change_id
2. WHEN generating change_id values THEN they SHALL be unique UUIDs for each modification session
3. WHEN displaying grouped changes THEN the UI SHALL visually group entries with the same change_id
4. WHEN a single field is changed THEN it SHALL still receive a unique change_id
5. WHEN querying audit logs THEN the API SHALL support grouping by change_id
6. WHEN exporting audit data THEN change_id SHALL be included to maintain grouping information

### Requirement 7: Performance and Data Retention

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the audit log system to perform efficiently and manage data retention appropriately so that system performance is maintained while preserving necessary audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit log tables grow large THEN database indexes SHALL ensure query performance remains acceptable
2. WHEN querying recent audit logs THEN response times SHALL be under 500ms for typical timecard audit requests
3. WHEN audit logs are older than 7 years THEN they MAY be archived or purged according to retention policies
4. WHEN audit log writes occur THEN they SHALL not significantly impact timecard modification performance
5. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN audit logging SHALL continue to function reliably
6. WHEN database maintenance occurs THEN audit log integrity SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 8: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want audit log access to be properly controlled and the audit trail itself to be tamper-evident so that the integrity of the audit system is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users request audit log data THEN access SHALL be restricted based on role permissions
2. WHEN administrators access audit logs THEN they SHALL see all audit entries for any timecard
3. WHEN regular users access audit logs THEN they SHALL only see audit entries for their own timecards
4. WHEN audit log entries are created THEN they SHALL be immutable (no updates or deletes allowed)
5. WHEN attempting to modify audit log entries THEN the system SHALL prevent such operations
6. WHEN audit log access is attempted THEN the access SHALL be logged for security monitoring
7. WHEN exporting audit data THEN appropriate authorization checks SHALL be performed

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Timecard Workflows

**User Story:** As a timecard system user, I want audit logging to work seamlessly with existing timecard operations so that my workflow is not disrupted while gaining audit trail benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the timecard rejection workflow THEN audit logs SHALL be created automatically without additional user action
2. WHEN editing timecards in draft mode THEN audit logs SHALL be created transparently
3. WHEN administrators make corrections THEN audit logs SHALL be created as part of the existing edit process
4. WHEN timecard operations fail THEN audit log creation SHALL not prevent proper error handling
5. WHEN viewing timecard details THEN audit trail information SHALL enhance rather than clutter the interface
6. WHEN existing timecard APIs are used THEN audit logging SHALL be integrated without breaking changes
7. WHEN timecard data is migrated or imported THEN appropriate audit log entries SHALL be created if needed
