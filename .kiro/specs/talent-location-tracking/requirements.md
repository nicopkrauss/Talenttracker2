# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Talent Location Tracking system enables talent escorts, supervisors, and coordinators to track and update the real-time locations of talent within active projects. This system integrates with the existing time tracking infrastructure and provides role-based access controls to ensure escorts can only manage their assigned talent while supervisors and coordinators have full access. The system supports both dedicated escorts and floater escorts who can manage any talent within the project.
