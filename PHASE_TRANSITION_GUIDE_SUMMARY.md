# Phase Transition Guide Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a comprehensive collapsible section to the Phase Configuration panel in the Settings tab that explains phase transitions, their triggers, and their relevance to project management.

## What Was Added

### New Collapsible Section: "Phase Transition Guide"
Located in `components/projects/phase-configuration-panel.tsx`, this section provides:

#### **Visual Phase Flow**
Each transition is displayed with:
- Source phase badge → Arrow → Target phase badge
- Clear trigger description
- Relevance explanation for why the transition matters

#### **Complete Phase Transitions Covered**

1. **Prep → Staffing**
   - **Trigger**: Setup Complete (role templates, locations, basic info configured)
   - **Relevance**: Unlocks team assignment and talent roster management

2. **Staffing → Pre-Show**
   - **Trigger**: Team Complete (essential roles filled, talent roster finalized)
   - **Relevance**: Enables assignment scheduling and final preparations

3. **Pre-Show → Active**
   - **Trigger**: Rehearsal Start (midnight local time on rehearsal start date)
   - **Relevance**: Activates time tracking, live operations dashboard, and real-time features

4. **Active → Post-Show**
   - **Trigger**: Show End (6AM local time next day after show end date)
   - **Relevance**: Shifts focus to timecard processing and payroll management

5. **Post-Show → Complete**
   - **Trigger**: All Timecards Processed (approved and payroll complete)
   - **Relevance**: Provides project summary and final reporting capabilities

6. **Complete → Archived**
   - **Trigger**: Archive Date (April 1st annually by default)
   - **Relevance**: Preserves historical data while reducing active project clutter

#### **Educational Context**
- Explains why phase-based management is beneficial
- Describes how each phase provides relevant features and workflows
- Emphasizes automatic progression without manual intervention

## Technical Implementation

### New Imports Added
```typescript
import { Collapsible, CollapsibleContent, CollapsibleTrigger } from '@/components/ui/collapsible'
import { ChevronDownIcon, InfoIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
```

### New State Variable
```typescript
const [isTransitionGuideOpen, setIsTransitionGuideOpen] = useState(false)
```

### UI Components Used
- **Collapsible**: For expandable/collapsible functionality

## Integration

### **Seamless Integration**
- Added to existing Phase Configuration panel
