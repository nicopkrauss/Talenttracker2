# Database Schema Audit Report
## Authentication System Overhaul - Task 2.1

### Executive Summary
The existing database schema is well-structured and compatible with the new authentication system. The profiles table contains all necessary fields for user management, and the enum values align with the authentication requirements.

### Profiles Table Structure

#### Core Fields
- `id`: UUID (Primary Key, references auth.users.id)
- `full_name`: String (Required)
- `email`: String (Required)
- `phone`: String (Optional)
- `city`: String (Optional)
- `state`: String (Optional)
- `profile_picture_url`: String (Optional)
- `status`: user_status enum (Default: pending)
- `role`: system_role enum (Optional)
- `created_at`: DateTime (Auto-generated)
- `updated_at`: DateTime (Auto-generated)

#### Relationships
- One-to-one with `auth.users` (Cascade delete)
- One-to-many with `email_notifications`
- One-to-many with `notifications`
- One-to-many with `projects` (as creator)
- One-to-many with `shifts`
- One-to-many with `timecards` (as user and approver)
- Multiple relationships with `talent_project_assignments`

#### Indexes
- `idx_profiles_role`: Index on role field for efficient role-based queries

### Enum Values

#### user_status
- `pending`: Awaiting admin approval (Default)
- `active`: Approved and active user
- `inactive`: Deactivated user account

#### system_role
- `admin`: Full system access
- `in_house`: System manager with configurable permissions

#### project_role (Separate from system roles)
- `supervisor`: On-site manager
- `coordinator`: Coordinator role
- `talent_escort`: Escort role

### Foreign Key Relationships

#### Primary Relationship
- `profiles.id` ‚Üí `auth.users.id` (CASCADE DELETE)
  - Ensures profile is deleted when auth user is deleted
  - Maintains referential integrity

#### Secondary Relationships
- Multiple tables reference `profiles.id` for user associations
- Proper cascade rules ensure data consistency

### Row Level Security (RLS) Status

#### Current State
- RLS is mentioned in Prisma comments for auth schema tables
- No explicit RLS policies found for public.profiles table
- This indicates RLS may need to be configured for the new auth system

#### Required RLS Policies (To Be Implemented)
1. Users can view their own profile
2. Users can update their own profile (limited fields)
3. Admins can view all profiles
4. Admins can update user status and roles

### Constraints and Validation

#### Database Constraints
- Check constraints exist but not fully supported by Prisma
- Primary key and foreign key constraints properly defined
- Unique constraints on critical fields

#### Application-Level Validation Needed
- Email format validation
- Phone number format validation
- Role assignment validation
- Status transition validation

### Compatibility Assessment

#### ‚úÖ Compatible Elements
- Profile structure supports all authentication requirements
- Enum values align with authentication workflows
- Foreign key relationships support user management
- Existing data can be preserved during auth system overhaul

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Requiring Attention
- RLS policies need to be implemented
- Some check constraints not enforced at database level
- Email uniqueness not enforced (should be handled in application)

#### üîß Recommended Enhancements
- Add RLS policies for security
- Implement email uniqueness validation
- Add database-level constraints for critical validations
- Consider adding audit trail for profile changes

### Migration Requirements

#### No Schema Changes Needed
- Existing schema fully supports new authentication system
- All required fields present and properly typed
- Relationships support authentication workflows

#### Configuration Changes Only
- RLS policy implementation
- Supabase Auth configuration
- Application-level validation updates

### Security Considerations

#### Current Security Gaps
- No RLS policies on profiles table
- Email uniqueness not enforced at database level
- No audit trail for sensitive profile changes

#### Recommended Security Measures
- Implement comprehensive RLS policies
- Add email uniqueness constraint
- Enable audit logging for profile modifications
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts

### Conclusion

The existing database schema is well-designed and fully compatible with the new authentication system. The profiles table contains all necessary fields, proper relationships, and appropriate enum values. The main work required is implementing RLS policies and ensuring proper security configurations rather than schema modifications.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Schema audit complete - No breaking changes required
**Next Steps**: Implement RLS policies and create profile service utilities
