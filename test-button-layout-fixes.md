# Button Layout Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Add Group Button Styling
**Problem**: The "Add Group" button had hardcoded white/black colors that didn't follow the design system or support dark mode.

**Solution**: Removed the custom `bg-white text-black border-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-50` classes and let the design system handle the styling through the `variant="outline"` prop.

**Result**: The button now properly follows the design system with:
- Light mode: `bg-background` with proper border and hover states
- Dark mode: `dark:bg-input/30 dark:border-input dark:hover:bg-input/50`

### 2. Confirm All Button Layout
**Problem**: The "Confirm All" button was creating a whole new table column, pushing everything over and creating excessive layout changes.

**Solution**: 
- Moved the button to the existing actions column (last column) instead of creating a new one
- Removed the extra empty `TableCell` elements that were added to talent and group rows
- Updated colSpan back to 4 instead of 5 for empty state messages
- Changed the table header structure to use the existing actions column

**Result**: The "Confirm All" button now appears in the table header's actions column without disrupting the table layout.

## Files Modified:

### `components/projects/tabs/talent-roster-tab.tsx`
- Fixed "Add Group" button styling by removing hardcoded colors
- Button now uses proper design system classes

### `components/projects/draggable-talent-list.tsx`
- Moved "Confirm All" button to existing actions column header
- Removed extra TableCell elements from talent and group rows
- Updated colSpan values back to 4
- Maintained proper table structure without layout shifts

## Expected Behavior:
- "Add Group" button appears in top right of Current Talent Assignments with proper theme-aware styling
- "Confirm All" button appears in the actions column header when there are pending changes
- No layout shifts or column additions when buttons appear/disappear
- Both buttons work properly in light and dark modes
- Table structure remains consistent and aligned
