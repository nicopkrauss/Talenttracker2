# Button Layout Changes Test

## Changes Made:

1. **Moved "Confirm All" button** from the top right of Current Talent Assignments section to the far right of the table header row (same row as "Name" and "Schedule")

2. **Moved "Add Group" button** from the Assign Talent section to where the "Confirm All" button previously existed (top right of Current Talent Assignments)

3. **Styled "Add Group" button** with white background and black text using `bg-white text-black border-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-50`

## Files Modified:

- `components/projects/tabs/talent-roster-tab.tsx`
- `components/projects/draggable-talent-list.tsx`

## Key Changes:

### In talent-roster-tab.tsx:
- Removed "Add Group" button from Assign Talent section
- Replaced "Confirm All" button area with "Add Group" button in Current Talent Assignments header
- Added new props to DraggableTalentList: `pendingChanges` and `onConfirmAll`

### In draggable-talent-list.tsx:
- Added new props to interface: `pendingChanges`, `onConfirmAll`, `isRequestActive`, `activeRequests`
- Added new table header column for "Confirm All" button
- Added empty TableCell to talent and group rows to maintain table structure
- Updated colSpan from 4 to 5 for empty state and loading messages
- Imported Check icon from lucide-react

## Expected Behavior:
- "Add Group" button now appears in top right of Current Talent Assignments with white background
- "Confirm All" button appears in table header row when there are pending changes
- Table structure remains intact with proper column alignment
