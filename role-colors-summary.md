# Role Color Scheme Implementation

## Color Scheme Applied

| Role | Color | Visual |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Admin** | Black | Black background, white text |
| **In-House** | Blue | Light blue background, dark blue text |
| **Supervisor** | Green | Light green background, dark green text |
| **Coordinator** | Purple | Light purple background, dark purple text |
| **Talent Escort** | Orange | Light orange background, dark orange text |

## Implementation

Added a `getRoleColor()` function that returns Tailwind CSS classes for each role type, including dark mode support. Applied to both:

1. **Staff Grid Cards**: Role badges in the 4-column staff grid
2. **Current Assignments**: Role badges in the assignments list

## Benefits

- **Instant Recognition**: Each role has a distinct color for quick identification
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Admin (black) stands out as highest authority
- **Better UX**: Reduces cognitive load when scanning staff lists
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors with dark mode support
- **Professional**: Maintains clean, professional appearance

The color coding makes it much easier for project managers to quickly identify and organize staff by their roles.
