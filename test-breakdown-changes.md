# Testing Breakdown Tab Changes

## Changes Made

1. **Moved total hours, rate, and total pay to header row**: These values are now displayed in the same row as the name, project, and days information.

2. **Replaced time display with timecard details UI**: The check-in, break start, break end, and check-out times now use the same UI components as the timecard details page with proper styling and layout.

3. **Multi-day expansion**: For multi-day timecards, only the first day is shown by default with a chevron button to expand and show all days.

4. **Consistent height**: Single-day and multi-day cards maintain the same height by reserving space for the expansion button in single-day cards.

## Key Features

- **Header Layout**: Total hours, rate, and total pay are now displayed as compact metrics in the header row
- **Time Details Grid**: Uses the same 4-column grid layout as the timecard details page
- **Expandable Multi-day**: Click the chevron to expand multi-day timecards to see all days
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the design patterns used in the timecard details and approve tabs

## Testing

1. Navigate to `/timecards` 
2. Check the "Breakdown" tab (or "My Timecards" for non-admin users)
3. Verify the layout changes:
   - Hours, rate, and total pay in header
   - Time details using card-based UI
   - Multi-day expansion functionality
   - Consistent card heights

The changes should provide a cleaner, more consistent interface that matches the design patterns used elsewhere in the application.
