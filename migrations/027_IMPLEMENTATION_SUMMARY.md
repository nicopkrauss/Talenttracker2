# Task 1 Implementation Summary: Daily Assignment Tables and Triggers

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

**Task**: Create new database tables and triggers for day-specific assignments

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 📋 Sub-tasks Implemented

### ✅ 1. Create `talent_daily_assignments` table with proper indexes and constraints
- **Table Structure**: UUID primary key, foreign keys to talent/project/profiles, assignment_date, timestamps
- **Unique Constraint**: Prevents duplicate escort assignments to same talent on same date
- **Performance Indexes**: 
  - `(project_id, assignment_date)` for fast date-based queries
  - `(escort_id, assignment_date)` for availability checking
  - `(talent_id, project_id)` for individual talent lookups
- **Date Validation**: Constraint ensures assignment dates fall within project date range

### ✅ 2. Create `group_daily_assignments` table with proper indexes and constraints  
- **Table Structure**: UUID primary key, foreign keys to talent_groups/project/profiles, assignment_date, timestamps
- **Unique Constraint**: Prevents duplicate escort assignments to same group on same date
- **Performance Indexes**: 
  - `(project_id, assignment_date)` for fast date-based queries
  - `(escort_id, assignment_date)` for availability checking
  - `(group_id, project_id)` for individual group lookups
- **Date Validation**: Constraint ensures assignment dates fall within project date range

### ✅ 3. Implement database triggers to automatically maintain `scheduled_dates` arrays
- **Talent Triggers**: Automatically update `talent_project_assignments.scheduled_dates` when daily assignments change
- **Group Triggers**: Automatically update `talent_groups.scheduled_dates` when daily assignments change
- **Event Coverage**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations all trigger scheduled_dates maintenance
- **Data Integrity**: Uses COALESCE to handle empty arrays, maintains sorted order

### ✅ 4. Add validation constraints for date ranges and duplicate prevention
- **Date Range Validation**: Assignment dates must be within project start/end dates
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Unique constraints prevent same escort assigned to same talent/group on same date
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints with CASCADE DELETE for data consistency
- **Updated Timestamps**: Automatic updated_at maintenance triggers

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### ✅ Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Enabled**: Both tables have RLS enabled
- **Project-Based Access**: Users can only access assignments for projects they're assigned to
- **Admin Override**: Admin and in_house roles have full access to all assignments
- **Secure by Default**: All operations respect user permissions

### ✅ Permissions and Documentation
- **Grants**: Proper permissions granted to authenticated users
- **Comments**: Comprehensive table and function documentation
- **Schema Usage**: Granted usage on public schema

## 🎯 Requirements Addressed

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the spec:

- **✅ Requirement 1.1**: "WHEN I assign an escort to talent for a specific date THEN the system SHALL store the escort-talent-date relationship independently from other dates"
- **✅ Requirement 1.2**: "WHEN I view talent assignments for a specific date THEN the system SHALL show only the escorts assigned for that date"
- **✅ Requirement 4.1**: "WHEN escort assignments are modified THEN the system SHALL ensure scheduled_dates arrays accurately reflect dates with active assignments"
- **✅ Requirement 4.2**: "WHEN an assignment is created THEN the system SHALL validate that the date falls within the project's date range"
- **✅ Requirement 4.3**: "WHEN an assignment is deleted THEN the system SHALL clean up any orphaned data relationships"

## 🚀 Next Steps

To apply this migration:

1. **Display Migration SQL**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/show-daily-assignment-migration.js
   ```

2. **Copy and Execute**: Copy the SQL output and run it in your Supabase SQL Editor

3. **Validate Success**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/validate-daily-assignment-migration.js
   ```

4. **Proceed to Task 2**: Create TypeScript types and interfaces for the new assignment system

## 🏗️ Architecture Impact

This migration establishes the foundation for the new day-specific assignment system:

- **Replaces**: Single `escort_id` field in `talent_project_assignments`
- **Replaces**: Redundant escort fields in `talent_groups` table
- **Enables**: Different escorts on different days for same talent/group
- **Enables**: Multiple escorts per group per date
- **Maintains**: Backward compatibility through automatic `scheduled_dates` maintenance
- **Improves**: Data integrity and query performance

## ✅ Task Status: COMPLETED

All sub-tasks have been successfully implemented. The migration is ready for deployment and testing.
