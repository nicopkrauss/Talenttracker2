#### 3. Project Assignment
- [ ] Lists available projects (not currently assigned)
- [ ] Allows multi-select of projects
- [ ] Validates selection (at least one project required)
- [ ] Successfully assigns talent to selected projects
- [ ] Updates UI after successful assignment

#### 4. Project Removal
- [ ] Removes talent from specific project
- [ ] Maintains other project assignments
- [ ] Updates UI after successful removal
- [ ] Shows loading state during removal

#### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Displays validation errors appropriately
- [ ] Handles network errors gracefully
- [ ] Shows success messages after operations
- [ ] Clears error messages when appropriate

#### 6. Requirements Verification

**Requirement 3.1**: ✅ Allows selection of multiple projects for a single talent
- Component includes checkbox interface for multi-select

**Requirement 3.2**: ✅ Maintains separate assignment records for each project
- Uses talent_project_assignments table with individual records

**Requirement 3.3**: ✅ Displays all current project assignments
- Shows current assignments in dedicated section

**Requirement 4.1**: ✅ Provides simple interface to change project assignments
- Checkbox selection and remove buttons provide intuitive interface

**Requirement 4.2**: ✅ Updates assignment records accordingly
- Uses proper Supabase queries to update assignment status

**Requirement 4.3**: ✅ Preserves core talent information
- Only modifies assignment records, not talent profile data

## Implementation Notes

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Multi-project assignment**: Checkbox interface allows selecting multiple projects
2. **Current assignments display**: Shows active assignments with remove functionality
3. **Project filtering**: Only shows available (unassigned) projects for selection
4. **Status management**: Uses 'active'/'inactive' status instead of deleting records
5. **Error handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
6. **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators for all async operations
7. **Validation**: Uses Zod schemas for data validation
8. **Audit trail**: Maintains assignment history through status changes

### Database Operations:
- **Fetch projects**: Gets all available projects from projects table
- **Fetch assignments**: Gets current active assignments for talent
- **Create assignments**: Inserts new assignment records
- **Remove assignments**: Updates status to 'inactive' (preserves audit trail)

### UI/UX Features:
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Clear feedback**: Success/error messages for all operations
- **Intuitive interface**: Checkbox selection, clear remove buttons
- **Loading states**: Prevents multiple submissions during operations
- **Empty states**: Helpful messages when no data available

## Integration Points

### With Existing Components:
- **TalentProfileForm**: Shares similar patterns and styling
- **Talent Detail Page**: Integrated as new "Projects" tab
- **Talent List Page**: Will show updated assignment counts

### Database Schema:
- **talent_project_assignments**: New many-to-many relationship table
- **projects**: Existing projects table for available projects
- **talent**: Existing talent table (unchanged by this component)

## Testing Results

✅ **Build Success**: Component compiles without errors
✅ **Type Safety**: All TypeScript interfaces properly defined
✅ **Pattern Consistency**: Follows existing component patterns
✅ **Requirements Coverage**: All specified requirements implemented
