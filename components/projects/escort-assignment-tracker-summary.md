# Escort Assignment Tracker Implementation Summary

## Overview
Replaced the basic schedule display in the project overview with a comprehensive escort assignment tracking system that shows day-by-day status of talent-escort assignments.

## Components Created

### EscortAssignmentTracker Component
- **Location**: `components/projects/escort-assignment-tracker.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Visual tracking of escort assignments for each project day
- **Integration**: Embedded in ProjectOverviewCard

## Features Implemented

### Visual Status Indicators
- **Complete Days**: Green checkmark icon with green background
- **Partial Days**: Amber filled circle with amber background  
- **Unassigned Days**: Empty circle with muted background

### Day Information Display
- **Date Labels**: Compact format (e.g., "Dec 15")
- **Day Type Badges**: "Show" (primary) and "Rehearsal" (secondary)
- **Assignment Counts**: Shows "assigned/required escorts" format
- **Missing Escorts**: Alert icon with count of needed escorts

### Overall Progress Tracking
- **Status Badges**: "All Assigned", "Partial", or "Not Started"
- **Progress Summary**: "X of Y days fully assigned" with percentage
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid showing up to 6 days per row

### Interactive Features
- **Hover Tooltips**: Detailed assignment info on hover
- **Click Preparation**: Ready for future navigation to assignment interface
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Mock Data Structure
Currently uses mock data to demonstrate functionality:
```typescript
interface DayAssignmentStatus {
  date: Date
  isComplete: boolean
  talentCount: number
  assignedEscorts: number
  requiredEscorts: number
}
```

## Future Integration Points
- **Talent Assignments**: Will connect to talent assignment system
- **Escort Assignments**: Will integrate with escort assignment data
- **Real-time Updates**: Prepared for live assignment status updates
- **Click Navigation**: Ready to link to detailed assignment interface
