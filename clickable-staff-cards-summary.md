# Clickable Staff Cards - Summary

## Changes Made

Updated the staff selection interface to make the entire card clickable instead of requiring users to click small checkboxes.

### Key Updates

1. **Removed Individual Checkboxes**: Eliminated the small checkboxes in the top-right corner of each staff card

2. **Made Cards Clickable**: The entire card area is now clickable for selection/deselection

3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: 
   - Selected cards have a white background (dark mode: slate-900) with primary border and shadow
   - Unselected cards maintain the default styling with hover effects
   - Smooth transitions between states

4. **Updated Select All Control**: 
   - Replaced checkbox with a button that shows "Select All" or "Deselect All"
   - Added selection counter showing how many staff are currently selected
   - Button text dynamically updates based on current selection state

5. **Improved Card Styling**:
   - Added `border-2` for better visual distinction when selected
   - Primary border color for selected state
   - Enhanced hover effects for unselected cards
   - Maintained all existing content (name, email, role badge, location, flight status)

### Technical Implementation

- **Selection Logic**: Click handler toggles selection state by adding/removing staff ID from Set
- **Visual States**: Conditional CSS classes based on `isSelected` boolean
- **Accessibility**: Maintained cursor pointer and proper contrast ratios
- **Responsive**: Grid layout preserved across all screen sizes

### User Experience Improvements

- **Larger Click Target**: Much easier to select staff members with full card area
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Selected cards are immediately distinguishable
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Natural clicking behavior instead of hunting for small checkboxes
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Larger touch targets for mobile users

The staff assignment interface now provides a much more user-friendly experience with clickable cards that clearly show selection state through visual styling changes.
