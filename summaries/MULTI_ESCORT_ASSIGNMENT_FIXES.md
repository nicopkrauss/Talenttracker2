# Multi-Escort Assignment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Error
**Problem**: Property `scheduled_dates` does not exist on type `TalentGroup`. Should use `scheduledDates`.
**Fix**: Updated `components/projects/draggable-talent-list.tsx` to use the correct property name.

### 2. API Logic for Clearing Escorts
**Problem**: When `escortIds` is an empty array `[]`, the API wasn't clearing the assignments because the condition `if (escortIds && escortIds.length > 0)` evaluated to false.
**Fix**: Updated `app/api/projects/[id]/assignments/route.ts` to handle empty arrays as clearing operations:

```typescript
// Before (broken)
if (escortIds && escortIds.length > 0) {
  updateData.assigned_escort_ids = escortIds
  updateData.assigned_escort_id = escortIds[0]
}

// After (fixed)
if (escortIds !== undefined) {
  updateData.assigned_escort_ids = escortIds
  updateData.assigned_escort_id = escortIds.length > 0 ? escortIds[0] : null
}
```

### 3. UI Data Refresh Issues
**Problem**: The UI was using optimistic updates but not refreshing data from the server after successful API calls. This meant that if there were any issues with the API calls or if the user reloaded, they would see stale data.
**Fix**: Added `await fetchAssignmentsForDate(selectedDate)` after all successful API operations in `components/projects/tabs/assignments-tab.tsx`:

- `handleAssignmentChange`: Added data refresh after successful assignment update
- `handleMultiDropdownChange`: Added data refresh after successful multi-dropdown update  
- `handleAddDropdown`: Added data refresh after successful dropdown addition
- `handleRemoveDropdown`: Added data refresh after successful dropdown removal

## How the Fixes Work

### Escort Clearing
1. User clicks "Clear Assignment" in dropdown
2. UI makes API call with `escortIds: []`
3. API correctly interprets empty array as clearing operation
4. Database is updated with `assigned_escort_ids: []` and `assigned_escort_id: null`
5. UI refreshes data from server to show cleared state

### Dropdown Removal
1. User clicks "Remove Escort Field" in dropdown
2. UI makes two API calls:
   - PATCH to talent-groups endpoint to update `escort_dropdown_count`
   - POST to assignments endpoint to update `escortIds` array
3. Both API calls succeed
4. UI refreshes data from server to show reduced dropdown count

### Data Consistency
- Optimistic updates provide immediate feedback
- Server refresh ensures data consistency
- Error handling rolls back optimistic updates if API calls fail
- User always sees the correct state after operations complete

## Testing Results

All database operations work correctly:
- ✅ Escort clearing: Empty `escortIds` array properly clears assignments
- ✅ Dropdown removal: `escort_dropdown_count` properly reduces
- ✅ Data persistence: Changes persist across page reloads
- ✅ UI consistency: UI shows correct state after server refresh

## Files Modified

1. `components/projects/draggable-talent-list.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript error
2. `app/api/projects/[id]/assignments/route.ts` - Fixed escort clearing logic
3. `components/projects/tabs/assignments-tab.tsx` - Added data refresh after API calls

The multi-escort assignment functionality now works correctly for both clearing escorts and removing dropdown fields.
