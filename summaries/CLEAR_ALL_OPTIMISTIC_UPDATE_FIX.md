# Clear All Optimistic Update Fix

## Problem Summary
The "Clear All" button was working correctly in the database but the optimistic update wasn't clearing escort assignments visually for groups. Individual talent assignments were clearing properly, but groups with multiple escort dropdowns were not being reset in the UI.

## Root Cause
The optimistic update in `handleClearDayAssignments` was only clearing the primary `escortId` and `escortName` properties but not the `escortAssignments` array that groups use for multiple escort dropdowns.

### Original Code (Problematic)
```typescript
// Optimistic update: Clear all assignments immediately
setScheduledTalent(prevTalent => 
  prevTalent.map(talent => ({
    ...talent,
    escortId: undefined,
    escortName: undefined
    // ❌ Missing: escortAssignments array for groups
  }))
)
```

### Fixed Code
```typescript
// Optimistic update: Clear all assignments immediately
setScheduledTalent(prevTalent => 
  prevTalent.map(talent => ({
    ...talent,
    escortId: undefined,
    escortName: undefined,
    // ✅ Added: Reset escortAssignments for groups
    escortAssignments: talent.isGroup ? [{ escortId: undefined, escortName: undefined }] : undefined
  }))
)
```

## File Changed
- **`components/projects/tabs/assignments-tab.tsx`**: Updated `handleClearDayAssignments` function

## How Groups Work
Groups use a different data structure than individual talent:

### Individual Talent
- Uses `escortId` and `escortName` for single escort assignment
- Simple dropdown interface

### Groups  
- Uses `escortAssignments` array for multiple escort assignments
- Each group can have multiple escort dropdowns
- Structure: `[{ escortId: string, escortName: string }, ...]`
- When cleared, resets to single empty dropdown: `[{ escortId: undefined, escortName: undefined }]`

## The Fix Explained

### Before Fix
1. User clicks "Clear All"
2. Optimistic update clears `escortId` and `escortName`
3. Individual talent assignments disappear ✅
4. Group assignments remain visible ❌ (escortAssignments array not cleared)
5. Database gets updated correctly
6. Page refresh shows cleared state

### After Fix
1. User clicks "Clear All"
2. Optimistic update clears:
   - `escortId` and `escortName` for all talent
   - `escortAssignments` array for groups (reset to single empty dropdown)
3. Individual talent assignments disappear ✅
4. Group assignments disappear ✅
5. Database gets updated correctly
6. UI matches database state immediately

## Testing Verification

### Test Steps
1. Go to assignments tab
2. Select a date with both individual talent and groups assigned with escorts
3. Click "Clear All" button
4. Verify all escort assignments disappear immediately from UI
5. Refresh page to confirm database was updated correctly

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ All individual talent escort assignments clear immediately
- ✅ All group escort assignments clear immediately  
- ✅ Groups show single empty dropdown after clearing
- ✅ Database is updated correctly
- ✅ If API fails, UI reverts to original state (rollback works)

## Related Components
The fix ensures consistency with how groups are handled throughout the system:

- **Group Creation**: Groups start with single empty dropdown
- **Group Editing**: Groups can have multiple escort dropdowns added
- **Clear All**: Groups reset to single empty dropdown
- **API Updates**: Groups use `escortAssignments` array in API calls

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes visual inconsistency in Clear All functionality
- ✅ Maintains proper optimistic update behavior
- ✅ Preserves rollback functionality on API errors
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Groups and individual talent now behave consistently

The Clear All button now provides immediate visual feedback for both individual talent and groups, matching the database state that was already being updated correctly.
