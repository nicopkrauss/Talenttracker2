# Assignment Cards Layout Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The assignment cards in the roles-team-tab.tsx component had a layout structure that was causing horizontal scrollbar issues and inconsistent button positioning compared to the staff cards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed JSX Syntax Error
- Resolved the syntax error around line 789 that was preventing the component from compiling
- Ensured proper JSX structure and closing elements

### 2. Layout Structure Improvements
The assignment cards now match the staff cards layout exactly:

#### Before (Problematic):
```jsx
<div className="flex flex-col h-full">
  <div className="mb-3"> {/* Header */}
  <div className="flex-1 space-y-2"> {/* Content */}
  <div className="flex justify-end gap-1 mt-3 pt-2 border-t"> {/* Buttons in separate row */}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```jsx
<div className="space-y-2.5">
  <div> {/* Header */}
  <div className="flex justify-between items-end">
    <div className="space-y-1.5 flex-1"> {/* Content */}
    <div className="ml-2 flex gap-1"> {/* Buttons inline */}
```

### 3. Key Layout Changes
1. **Removed `flex-col h-full`** - Simplified to `space-y-2.5`
2. **Added `flex justify-between items-end`** - Content left, buttons right, aligned to bottom
3. **Removed border separator** - No more `border-t border-border/50`
4. **Inline button positioning** - `ml-2 flex gap-1` exactly like staff cards
5. **Proper nesting structure** - Content and buttons are siblings in the flex container

### 4. Button Positioning
- Edit and Remove buttons are now positioned in the bottom-right corner
- Buttons are integrated into the content flow rather than having their own separate row
- Layout matches the "Assign" button positioning in staff cards

## Result
- ✅ No more horizontal scrollbar issues
- ✅ Consistent layout between staff and assignment cards
- ✅ Proper button positioning in bottom-right corner
- ✅ Clean, integrated design without border separators
- ✅ Successful build compilation

## Files Modified
- `components/projects/tabs/roles-team-tab.tsx` - Fixed assignment card layout structure

The assignment cards now have the same clean, consistent layout as the staff cards, with buttons properly positioned inline rather than in a separate row.
