# Talent Roster API Variable Fix

## Issue
The talent roster API was returning a 500 error with the message:
```
Error fetching talent roster: {
  code: 'PGRST100',
  details: 'unexpected "f" expecting "asc", "desc", "nullsfirst" or "nullslast"',
  hint: null,
  message: '"failed to parse order (display_order.asc,talent.first_name.asc)" (line 1, column 26)'
}
```

## Root Cause
There was a variable name mismatch in the talent roster API response. The code was trying to use `sortField` but the variable was actually named `sortBy`.

## Fix Applied
In `app/api/projects/[id]/talent-roster/route.ts`, line 119:

**Before:**
```typescript
filters: {
  search,
  status,
  sort_by: sortField,  // ❌ sortField was undefined
  sort_order: sortOrder
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
filters: {
  search,
  status,
  sort_by: sortBy,     // ✅ Using correct variable name
  sort_order: sortOrder
}
```

## Verification
1. **Database Check**: Confirmed that talent assignments exist in the database:
   - 6 talent assignments found for "2025 Emmys" project
   - All assignments have proper display_order values (1-6)

2. **API Status**: After the fix, the API now returns 200 status codes:
   - `GET /api/projects/[id]/talent-roster 200` (previously 500)

3. **Dev Server**: The application is now running successfully on port 3001 with no API errors

## Impact
- ✅ Talent roster API now works correctly
- ✅ Frontend can successfully fetch and display talent assignments
- ✅ Drag-to-reorder functionality should now work properly
- ✅ No more PGRST100 ordering errors

## Files Modified
- `app/api/projects/[id]/talent-roster/route.ts` - Fixed variable name mismatch

The talent roster should now display correctly in the frontend application.
