# Escort Selection Popover - Show Day Fix

## Problem Summary
Two issues were identified with the escort selection popover:

1. **Missing "Already Assigned" Section on Show Days**: The "Already Assigned for <today>" section was not appearing on show days, making it impossible to see which escorts were already assigned.

2. **UI Clutter**: The "Already Assigned" section was always expanded, taking up space in the dropdown even when not needed.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Show Day Filtering
The problem was in the `organizedEscorts` logic in `components/projects/assignment-dropdown.tsx`:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
if (isShowDay) {
  // Show day: only show available escorts
  return {
    available: filtered.filter(escort => escort.section === 'available'),
    rehearsalAssigned: [],
    currentDayAssigned: [] // ❌ This was being filtered out on show days
  }
}
```

This logic was intentionally hiding already-assigned escorts on show days, but this prevented users from:
- Seeing who was already assigned
- Reassigning escorts if needed (conflict resolution)
- Understanding the full assignment state

### Issue 2: Always Expanded UI
The "Already Assigned" section was rendered as a simple list without any collapsible functionality, making the dropdown cluttered when there were many assigned escorts.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Remove Show Day Filtering
```typescript
// FIXED CODE
// Always show all sections - removed show day filtering
return {
  available: filtered.filter(escort => escort.section === 'available'),
  rehearsalAssigned: filtered.filter(escort => escort.section === 'rehearsal_assigned'),
  currentDayAssigned: filtered.filter(escort => escort.section === 'current_day_assigned')
}
```

### Fix 2: Add Collapsible Interface
Added collapsible functionality using the existing UI components:

```typescript
// Added imports
import {
  Collapsible,
  CollapsibleContent,
  CollapsibleTrigger,
} from '@/components/ui/collapsible'
import { ChevronRight } from 'lucide-react'

// Added state
const [isCurrentDayAssignedOpen, setIsCurrentDayAssignedOpen] = useState(false)

// Wrapped section in Collapsible
<Collapsible open={isCurrentDayAssignedOpen} onOpenChange={setIsCurrentDayAssignedOpen}>
  <CollapsibleTrigger asChild>
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between px-2 py-1.5 text-xs font-medium text-destructive hover:bg-accent cursor-pointer">
      <span>Already Assigned for {date}</span>
      <ChevronRight className={`h-3 w-3 transition-transform ${isCurrentDayAssignedOpen ? 'rotate-90' : ''}`} />
    </div>
  </CollapsibleTrigger>
  <CollapsibleContent>
    {/* Escort list */}
  </CollapsibleContent>
</Collapsible>
```

## File Changed
- **`components/projects/assignment-dropdown.tsx`**: Updated escort filtering logic and added collapsible interface

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ Show days: No "Already Assigned" section visible
- ❌ Rehearsal days: Section always expanded, cluttering UI
- ❌ No way to see assignment conflicts on show days
- ❌ No way to reassign escorts on show days

### After Fix
- ✅ Show days: "Already Assigned" section appears when needed
- ✅ All days: Section is collapsible and collapsed by default
- ✅ Clean UI: Only expand when you need to see assignments
- ✅ Conflict resolution: Can still assign already-assigned escorts
- ✅ Visual feedback: ChevronRight icon rotates when expanded

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Added `isCurrentDayAssignedOpen` state (defaults to `false`)
- Controlled by Collapsible component
- Persists during dropdown session

### Visual Design
- Maintains existing red color scheme for "Already Assigned" section
- Added hover effect on collapsible trigger
- Smooth rotation animation for ChevronRight icon
- Consistent with existing UI patterns

### Accessibility
- Uses proper Collapsible components with ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Screen reader friendly

## Impact on Workflow

### Show Day Operations
- Users can now see all escort assignments on show days
- Enables better coordination and conflict resolution
- Maintains ability to reassign if needed

### UI Cleanliness
- Dropdown is less cluttered by default
- Users can expand sections only when needed
- Faster scanning of available escorts

### Consistency
- Same behavior across rehearsal and show days
- Consistent with collapsible patterns used elsewhere in the app

## Testing Verification

### Test Steps
1. Navigate to assignments tab on a show day
2. Click escort dropdown for any talent/group
3. Verify "Already Assigned for <date>" section appears
4. Verify section is collapsed by default
5. Click to expand and see assigned escorts
6. Verify ChevronRight icon rotates
7. Verify you can still assign already-assigned escorts

### Expected Results
- ✅ Section appears on both rehearsal and show days
- ✅ Section is collapsed by default
- ✅ Clicking expands/collapses the section
- ✅ Icon rotates smoothly
- ✅ Assigned escorts are still selectable
- ✅ UI is cleaner and less cluttered

The fix successfully addresses both the functional issue (missing assignments on show days) and the UX issue (cluttered interface) while maintaining all existing functionality.
