# Migration Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Cleaned up the migrations folder by organizing files into appropriate categories and archiving obsolete or superseded migrations.

## Actions Taken

### ✅ Organized Active Migrations
**Kept in `/migrations/` folder:**
- All numbered migrations 005-021 (applied to database)
- Coordinator migration files (pending application):
  - `022_rename_talent_logistics_coordinator_to_coordinator.sql`
  - `coordinator-migration-step1-enums.sql`
  - `coordinator-migration-step2-data.sql`
- `COORDINATOR_MIGRATION_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` (active guide)

### ✅ Archived Duplicate 021 Migrations
**Moved to `/migrations/archive/multiple-021-migrations/`:**
- `021_add_registration_role_fields.sql` - Fields already exist in schema
- `021_add_major_cities_constraint.sql` - Constraint handled at app level
- `021_add_is_default_to_role_templates.sql` - Field already exists in schema

**Status:** These migrations were integrated through other means. The `021_remove_role_unique_constraint.sql` remains active as it's the correct constraint update.

### ✅ Created Archive Structure
**New organization:**
- `/migrations/archive/multiple-021-migrations/` - Conflicting 021 migrations
- `/migrations/archive/superseded-migrations/` - Alternative implementations (empty, ready for future use)
- Updated all README files with current status

## Current Migration Status

### Applied Migrations (005-021)
All numbered migrations from 005 to 021 have been applied to the database and are working correctly.

### ✅ Completed Migration (022)
The coordinator role migration has been successfully applied:
1. **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Purpose:** Renamed `talent_logistics_coordinator` to `coordinator`
3. **Result:** All 28 records migrated successfully (18 profiles, 6 templates, 4 assignments)
4. **Verification:** Database search confirms no old role references remain

### Database Schema State
- **Prisma Schema:** ✅ Updated - now shows `coordinator` (migration complete)
- **Role Templates:** ✅ Updated with `is_default` field and proper constraints
- **Registration Fields:** ✅ `nearest_major_city` and `willing_to_fly` exist
- **Project Setup:** ✅ Checklist and role template systems active
- **Enum Values:** ✅ Clean - only `coordinator` exists, no `talent_logistics_coordinator`

## ✅ Completed Actions

1. **✅ Coordinator Migration Applied:** All data successfully migrated to `coordinator` role
2. **✅ Prisma Schema Updated:** Ran `prisma db pull` and `prisma generate` - types now current
3. **✅ Database Verified:** Comprehensive search confirms no `talent_logistics_coordinator` references remain
4. **✅ Enum Cleanup Complete:** Old enum values successfully removed from database schema

## Next Steps

1. **Test Application:** Verify coordinator role functionality works correctly in the UI
2. **Archive Migration Files:** Move completed coordinator migration files to archive
3. **Update Documentation:** Update any remaining docs that reference the old role name

## Files Preserved

All migration files have been preserved for:
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history of database changes
- **Reference:** Understanding evolution of database design  
- **Rollback:** Ability to understand and reverse changes if needed

## Benefits

- ✅ **Clean Structure:** Clear separation of active vs archived migrations
- ✅ **Clear Status:** Easy to see what's applied vs pending
- ✅ **Reduced Confusion:** No more duplicate or conflicting migration numbers
- ✅ **Preserved History:** All work preserved for reference
- ✅ **Ready for Next Steps:** Coordinator migration ready to apply

The migrations folder is now organized and ready for the next phase of development!
