# Group Display Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the talent group display in the Current Talent Assignments section to show more relevant information and provide a cleaner user interface.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Removed Expand/Collapse Arrows**
- **Before**: Groups showed chevron arrows (ChevronDown/ChevronRight) indicating expand/collapse state
- **After**: Clean interface without visual clutter from arrows
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, more professional appearance

### 2. **Smart Contact Display**
- **Before**: Always showed first 2 members with "+X more" format
- **After**: Intelligent display priority:
  1. **Point of Contact** (if available) with optional phone number
  2. **First Group Member** (fallback when no POC)
  3. **"No members"** (edge case for empty groups)

### 3. **Point of Contact Integration**
- **Format**: `Contact Name â€¢ Phone Number`
- **Examples**:
  - `Brian Epstein â€¢ +44 20 7946 0958` (full contact info)
  - `Sarah Manager` (name only, no phone)
  - `Mike Singer` (fallback to first member)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Supports both camelCase and snake_case field names

### 4. **Cleaned Expanded Member View**
- **Removed**: "Follows group schedule" text from schedule column
- **Removed**: Grey background (`bg-muted/30`) from member rows
- **Result**: Cleaner, more consistent visual hierarchy

### 5. **Maintained Functionality**
- **Expand/Collapse**: Still works by clicking anywhere on the group name area
- **Drag & Drop**: Group reordering functionality preserved
- **Schedule Management**: Group-level scheduling unchanged
- **Member Management**: Individual member display and management preserved

## Technical Implementation

### Component Changes
**File**: `components/projects/draggable-talent-list.tsx`

#### Display Logic Update
```tsx
{!isExpanded && (
  <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    {group.pointOfContactName || group.point_of_contact_name ? (
      <>
        {group.pointOfContactName || group.point_of_contact_name}
        {(group.pointOfContactPhone || group.point_of_contact_phone) && (
          <span className="ml-2">â€¢ {group.pointOfContactPhone || group.point_of_contact_phone}</span>
        )}
      </>
    ) : (
      group.members.length > 0 ? group.members[0].name : 'No members'
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

#### Removed Elements
- Chevron icons from group header
- "Follows group schedule" text from expanded members
- Grey background class from member rows

### Data Flow
1. **Point of Contact Priority**: Check for POC name first
2. **Phone Number Addition**: Append phone with bullet separator if available
3. **Member Fallback**: Use first member name if no POC
4. **Empty State**: Handle groups with no members gracefully

## User Experience Improvements

### Before vs After

#### **Before**:
```
â–¼ The Beatles [Group Badge]
  John Lennon, Paul McCartney +2 more
```

#### **After** (with POC):
```
The Beatles [Group Badge]
Brian Epstein â€¢ +44 20 7946 0958
```

#### **After** (without POC):
```
Local Band [Group Badge]
Mike Singer
```

### Benefits
1. **More Relevant Information**: Contact person is more useful than member list
2. **Professional Appearance**: Contact details suggest organized management
3. **Cleaner Interface**: Reduced visual clutter and unnecessary text
4. **Better Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between group and member information
5. **Practical Value**: Phone numbers enable direct communication

## Testing Coverage

### Test Scenarios
âœ… **Group with full POC info** (name + phone)
âœ… **Group with POC name only** (no phone)
âœ… **Group without POC** (fallback to first member)
âœ… **Empty group** (edge case handling)
âœ… **Backward compatibility** (database field names)

### Manual Testing Checklist
