# UI Improvements - Assignments Tab

## Summary
Fixed three specific UI issues in the assignments tab scheduling interface as requested by the user.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Talent Count Display
**File:** `components/projects/assignment-list.tsx`
**Change:** Removed the "x talent scheduled" text from the day section header next to the Clear Day button
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  {scheduledTalent.length} {scheduledTalent.length === 1 ? 'talent' : 'talent'} scheduled
</div>
```
**After:** Completely removed this div element

### 2. Fixed Spacing Issues in Card Header
**File:** `components/projects/tabs/assignments-tab.tsx`
**Changes:** 
1. Made CardContent render conditionally to prevent empty padding space
2. Increased spacing between header rows for better visual separation

**Before:** 
- `<CardContent>` always rendered with `px-6` padding, even when empty
- `<CardHeader>` used default `gap-1.5` (6px) between rows

**After:** 
- `{projectSchedule.isSingleDay && (<CardContent>...)}` only renders when needed
- `<CardHeader className="gap-4">` provides 16px spacing between rows

**Issues Fixed:** 
- Empty CardContent was creating unwanted purple spacing below progress row
- Insufficient spacing between "Select A Day" row and progress row

### 3. Increased Progress Bar Width
**File:** `components/projects/tabs/assignments-tab.tsx`
**Change:** Increased progress bar width by 1.5x (rounded to nearest even number)
**Before:** `w-64` (256px)
**After:** `w-96` (384px)
**Calculation:** 256px Ã— 1.5 = 384px (exactly matches w-96 Tailwind class)

## Components Affected
- `components/projects/assignment-list.tsx` - Removed talent count display
- `components/projects/tabs/assignments-tab.tsx` - Fixed spacing issues and increased progress bar width

## Preserved Functionality
- Clear Day button remains fully functional
- Progress bar calculation and animation unchanged
- Empty state message "No talent scheduled for this day" preserved (different from removed count)
- All other UI elements and functionality maintained

## Testing
Created comprehensive test script `scripts/test-ui-improvements.js` that verifies:
- Talent count text removal
- Clear Day button preservation
- Spacing reduction
- Progress bar width increase
- No remnants of old code

All tests pass successfully.
